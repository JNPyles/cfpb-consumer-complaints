I've reviewed prior replies from Wells Fargo reps, there is absolutely no mention of their runaround mediation forms ...

These forms are sent in reply to unauthorized accounts opened by Wells Fargo reps including account ending XXXX, account ending in XXXX, a XXXXy account, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to accounts opened, my credit has been impacted, XXXX XXXX dropped, denied credit. Wells Fargo extent to addressing fraudulent credit accounts includes closing accounts and removing from credit file, no reimbursement for damages to credit. It appears Wells Fargo refuses to address issue pertaining to runaround with their mediation request forms, a total of XXXX or more of these forms have been filled out, returned, acknowledgement letters received..Please note, last XXXX forms filled out were in good faith, additional forms will be refused... The last tracking ID provided by mediation program is XXXX. When the number on letter is called, XXXX, I am told mediation efforts exhausted or am hung up on as per usual.. With regard to any efforts made, I believe this refers to a prior mediation from XXXX, in which case, this mediation refers to older deposit accounts from around XXXX, also unauthorized. I can assure the CFPB no such efforts made with regard to accounts unauthorized including checking account ending in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ending in XXXX. Further, no reimbursement for purchase made under account ending XXXX, an item from XXXX in amount of {$290.00}, item never received. Previously, a payment in amount of {$3700.00} was offered to me by XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX, sent to my old address after moving, never received.

It appears Wells Fargo reps are attempting to offer these payments in leiu of their runaround with mediation forms... .They claim these payments stem from charges for products /services charged on prior deposit accounts... I can assure the CFPB this is a lie. The payments appear to be sent each time additional CFPB complaint filed, possibly in leiu of their mediation request forms which are a mere runaround. These payments were not mediated or agreed to, do not cover damages, will not be accepted. XXXX WellsFargo rep claims checks in amounts of {$400.00}, {$50.00} cashed, in which case, not by myself. As stated before, payments do not cover damages, not received.

Upon contacting XXXX, they confirmed that the transaction did not originate from my personal account and suggested that my debit card may have been compromised and linked to another individual 's XXXX account for fraudulent purposes. 

Following XXXX 's acknowledgment of the unauthorized transaction, I immediately reached out to Credit Karma Money to dispute the charge.

I appealed the decision twice, investing significant time and effort into collecting and presenting additional evidence. However, both appeals were denied without proper consideration or review of the provided documentation. Notably, the final denial was issued less than XXXX minutes after submitting my appeal, indicating a lack of thorough examination. 

As a longtime user and customer of Credit Karma Money, I am deeply disappointed by their handling of this matter. Their failure to adequately investigate and address the unauthorized charge has left me financially vulnerable and feeling disregarded as a customer.

In XXXX of last year, during a high volume of personal transactions due to relocating and preparing for the new school year like renting house, getting deposit from previous landlord, and purchasing second hand used furnitures from individuals, which caused many transactions. Chase Bank froze my account without providing a specific reason. They informed me that an investigation would be conducted and that it might take up to three months. Furthermore, they stated that following the investigation, the account would be closed and any funds would be returned to me via check. 

It has now been over six months since the closure of my account, and I have yet to receive the check for my balance, which exceeds {$5800.00}. This situation has severely impacted my financial stability, affecting my ability to manage daily expenses and academic commitments. 

Despite repeated attempts to resolve this issue with Chase Bank, there has been minimal communication and no satisfactory explanation or evidence provided as to why my account was subject to such action. The delay in returning my funds and the lack of transparency are not only inconvenient but also distressing. 

Given these circumstances, I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene on my behalf to expedite the investigation and the return of my funds.

I only use that payment function to send rent to my brother, and pay my mother or partner- XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. All of these names are listed in my transaction history. Ive included screenshots of my past Pay a friend transactions to SoFi to show this history. 

I tried to cancel this transaction as suggested by SoFi, however - SoFi did not allow it. I tried to dispute the transaction, but SoFi said the transaction must be posted. I clearly did not want this posted on my account, that is why I am disputing it. 

I read that the report says this is rejected due to a geolocation being used and therefore rejected- all that confirms is that someone accessed my account without my awareness or authorization. That does not make me responsible for a transaction I did not send or authorize. I am speaking to my awareness of the situation and the impact it has caused with my finances and trust using SOFI. 

That is not a transaction I authorized or a recipient I know. I even locked my debit card as soon as I noticed this {$390.00} posted to my account. This is the only transaction I have ever asked to dispute.

Although it was my understanding that DEBIT meant "" only successful in transactions for money in account '' that if there wasn't enough money to completed payment, then transaction HAD TO BE DENIED FOR NON SUFFICIENT FUNDS. But USBANK 's response to my issue was, "" on mobile app ONLY, the permission to allow overdrafts is defaulted TO ALLOW... on debit account. I FEEL THAT IS INTENTIONAL FRAUD FOR FEES INCURRED BY THESE NON SUFFICIENT FUNDS TRANSACTIONS. So I immediately opened mobile app and after digging extremely deep into account permissions, I finally found and deactivated the allowance of INSUFFICIENT FUNDS transactions being processed. Us Bank reversed the transactions from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AND XXXX, removed penaltly fees and put my account bank into positive balance. BUT THEN US BANK IMMEDIATELY ALLOWED SAME COMPANIES, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, to process SAME TRANSACTIONS. My denial of overdraft permission WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED. This was 2nd complaint w CFPB I filed in USBANK. CFPB kicked it out as a duplicate. UsBank was misunderstanding my complaint. The overdraft default edit to NOT ALLOW, should have been enough defense. And the fact that CFPB closed my cases claiming duplicate and now I read on CFPB website that USBANK is on the list of banks WHO DO NOT CHARGE OVERDRAFT OR NSF FEES.

I was told it would arrive in 5-7 business days. Accounting for the XXXX XXXX holiday, today is day XXXX if it was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX.

Each time I am told to "" wait another day or two '' or that they can issue a new check after a "" 1-2 business day review to see if the check has been cashed '' but that it will take "" another 5-7 business days '' for a new check to arrive. I am not interested in going through this process again. I am traveling abroad and this checking account is the only access to funds that I have. To say this has been an inconvenience is a gross understatement. I have begun to question if the check was ever mailed at all.

I never received this information. All I received was the original message that the claim had been denied. That message said that the merchant was contacted by phone and provided proof that I authorized this transaction. I want to know what that proof is because in XXXX all XXXX debit cards are ran as "" XXXX '' so no pin is required. I also did not sign any receipt for this purchase.

This has happened too often and for too long to me. There should be some intervention whereas consumers checks can be honored without being embarrassed and discriminated against. Telecheck should not continue to be allowed to have consumers checks declined for no good reason due to the check amount patterns.

My medicine costs hundreds of dollars and I was denied access to it due to TeleCheck and not due to insufficient funds. Telecheck already has too much personal information, and it is the consumer like me who is suffering.

I completed the terms of this offer, opening the account on XX/XX/2023 with the promotional code "" XXXX ''. I was able to deposit just over {$XXXX} to the account within the timeframe indicated ( approximately XXXX weeks ), and held those monies in the account for the duration indicated ( in fact, all of these monies remain in this account, as I write ). 

I became concerned, earlier this week, that the {$XXXX} bonus hadn't posted, per the terms of the agreement. I contacted Capital One ( by phone ) on XXXX, and spoke with a Customer Service Representative named "" XXXX, '' who informed me that I had failed to complete one particular component of the bonus requirements, which I will explain below. 

This particular account opening bonus was for individuals without an open XXXX XXXX Savings Account. I was able to successfully open the account ( online ), and have the promotional code applied. In the next day or two, when I was initiating online access for my ( new ) account, I noticed that there were two existing accounts ( XXXXne for each of my ( now ) adult children ), with a penny in each. These accounts had been opened, and essentially abandoned, approximately 12 years prior. Realizing I had these abandoned accounts still "" hanging around, '' I immediately closed them. 

I guess my concern is how could I have possibly known that there were two ( decade old ) savings accounts "" on my record '' with Capital One, if I had received no communication regarding these accounts in 10+ years? Furthermore, I think it unfair ( and perhaps predatory, I'm not sure ) that Capital One would allow me to open my new account, accept the bonus code ( as one of my attached photos will show ), and not inform me that there was this technicality that would prevent me from receiving my bonus until months later, when *I* initiated a phone call. Frankly, it appears that Capital One would have had to have known that I would ( ultimately ) be ineligible for this bonus from the start, and let this whole affair play out for months on end. It seems rather inappropriate and unfair to me.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,MA,014XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/04/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8925225,"A consumer opened a Capital One account with a promotional code for a bonus, meeting the deposit and maintenance requirements.

On numerous occasions, Truist has levied a maintenance fee of {$12.00} against my account, despite consistently maintaining a sufficient balance in my savings account to waive these fees. My combined savings and checking balance was significantly in excess of the {$1500.00} they claim I needed to maintain, again, despite being told that my new account type does not carry these restrictions. Despite repeated attempts to rectify this issue, the problem persists, causing undue financial strain and frustration. This blatant disregard for their own commitments is both unacceptable and unethical. 

Moreover, Truist agreed to refund XXXX late fees erroneously charged to my account. While they have refunded XXXX of the fees as promised, the second refund is yet to be issued. Surprisingly, their customer service rep stated that she could not see XXXX maintenance fee charges on my account, when in reality, there were XXXX. Despite assurances that they would promptly investigate and rectify the situation, I have not received any updates or communication regarding the status of this refund. When I contact Truist, I am told that they will have a "" supervisor '' look into it and that is that. 

This ongoing pattern of incompetence and negligence on the part of Truist has not only resulted in unwarranted financial losses but has also eroded my trust and confidence in their ability to manage my accounts effectively and responsibly. 

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that Truist is held accountable for their actions. I seek a full refund of all unauthorized maintenance fees charged to my account, as well as immediate resolution regarding the outstanding late fee refund. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift and satisfactory resolution.

REFER to XXXX. 

Have included the XXXX  Help Desk address to see if they could confirm my suspicions that the imaged checks were both created stamped and endorsed with a fake signature on XX/XX/XXXX shortly after an unregistered XXXX device had access to my account.

Personally never had these checks in possession let alone utilized in a remote Mobile Deposit.

Supporting Information : A. I have tried to contact US Bank and it is virtually impossible to get someone to talk to because of their VRU ( Voice Response Unit ) and even when you do, the representative hangs up on you after 15 minutes of discussion after wasting much of my valuable time. The call was XXXX minutes in length on XX/XX/XXXX beginning at XXXX XXXX  MST to phone number XXXX. 

B. US Bank also does not have a secure message facility so the only way to communicate is via a voice call which is difficult when the US Bank representative hangs-up after many minutes of discussion without offering any help whatsoever. 

C. The only other way is to visit a US Bank brick and mortar location miles away which is difficult for me because I XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ergo, this is the reason I opened the account online in the first place. 

D. I opened the above account on XX/XX/XXXX. I am due a bonus of {$500.00} for opening the Smartly Checking Account and meeting all the requirements listed below. The numbered paragraphs are the requirements to receive the bonus incentive : 1. You must not have a current consumer checking account or a consumer checking account in the past XXXX years and you must be the owner on the new checking account. 

I am the only owner of this account and I have never had a US Bank consumer checking account or received any kind of prior bonus from US Bank at any time. 

2. You must use the promo code when opening the checking account. 

I did use the promo code XXXX when I opened the account in XXXX. 

3. You must deposit a minimum of {$25.00} when opening the Account. 

I did deposit {$25.00} when I opened the account online see attachment 1 US Bank transaction list.

4. Additionally, you must enroll in the U.S. Bank Mobile App or online banking within XXXX days of opening your account. 

I created an online account immediately after opening the account in XX/XX/XXXX and have been actively using Online Banking since XXXX, XXXX. 




5. You must also complete XXXX or more direct deposits within 90 days of opening your account that total : {$5000.00} to {$9900.00} to earn the {$300.00} bonus or {$10000.00} or more to earn the {$500.00} bonus. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I made XXXX qualifying deposits from ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX ) via benefits ( other XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) and ( XXXX ) federal benefit credit XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX ). these deposit totaled {$10000.00} which qualifies me for the {$500.00} cash bonus. 

6. Your checking bonus ( "" adjusted interest "" ) will be credited to your new checking account within 60 days following the end of the calendar month during which you completed all of the offer requirements All requirements for the {$500.00} cash bonus were met by XX/XX/XXXX and the end of that month is XX/XX/XXXX and the XXXX days from XX/XX/XXXX 60 days expired on XX/XX/XXXX. Today is XX/XX/XXXX so US Bank is delinquent in paying me my {$500.00} cash bonus promised. 

7. Account must be open and have a positive balance to receive the bonus.

As of this date, the account is open and in good standing with a current balance of {$15000.00}.

8. This offer may not be combined with any other Checking account bonus offers.

This bonus offer is not being combined with any other bonus offer.

05/15/24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I had my tax return direct deposited into Credit Karma Money Account. I had a trip I was taking where I was going out of the country for about a Month maybe a little over a Month. I already had my trip and everything financially covered and so I planned to leave my tax return in my account and of course if ever needed Im able to use, but fortunately and unfortunately I never needed to go into my account and use any of the funds. The day before my trip I went to a local site seeing spot where you could see the whole city, I took a short walk down a small path, and I returned back to my vehicle and the mountain was getting ready to be closed so I went ahead and started leaving off the mountain when I got to the bottom and discovered my phone and wallet were missing so when I went on that small walk on the path, someone went into my vehicle and stole my wallet and phone out of my car. I drove back up the mountain but it was already closed. I had to get a new phone the next morning and had to cancel all my cards etc. The person who stole my phone had at that point already gained access into my phone and then had access to my accounts and everything else I had on my phone, this is where they got the virtual card number to use it on XXXX XXXX to send to themselves and drain it completely. I didnt know my account was being used or anything until I got back from my trip, When I returned back from my trip, I at this point was in need to use my funds from my tax return due to over spending on my trip, the only funds I had was my tax return so I was glad to have that still, so I returned and needed to use some money and went to check my account and all of my tax return was drained from my account in only XXXX transactions my whole tax return was wiped out of my account, all XXXX transactions were from Cash App. 
My total return was {$5900.00}, All XXXX Transactions are XXXX XXXX - {$500.00} XXXX XXXX - {$500.00} XXXX XXXX - {$50.00} XXXX XXXX - {$500.00} XXXX XXXX - {$450.00} XXXX XXXX - {$110.00} XXXX XXXX - {$880.00} XXXX XXXX - {$10.00} XXXX XXXX - {$2900.00} Shown on Statement as : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX US All the Transactions show the date, the amount and then the description. 
They all say the same thing and to the same XXXX XXXX. 
Ive disputed these transactions with XXXX Credit Karma Money, they told me that this will be resolved, that if they needed to investigate more then XXXX business days then I would receive a provisional credit, they resolved it by denying every transaction saying this in a letter, We have completed our research regarding your dispute and have determined that no error occurred, Regulation E only covers unauthorized transactions. Since these are charges that you did authorize it is not considered to be fraudulent activity. 

I called them and told them that those transactions were NOT authorized and that I need them to reopen my disputes because not a single one of those are authorized, they clearly state Regulation E only covers unauthorized transactions, well those transactions are UNAUTHORIZED FRAUDULENTLY. 
They said they would send it to a team for a second review and get back to me. 
They sent me an email stating that they again found those transactions to be authorized. If Im telling them they were not authorized and they are supposed to be FDIC insured, but yet they dont want to give me back all the XXXX they are going against what Im telling them. 
I have looked up this same situation online to see if anyone has had a similar issue and its a very common issue a lot of consumers have had with their XXXX Credit Karma Money account. They never want to give anyone back their money, they deny everyones disputes and this is just unacceptable, its extremely upsetting that after discovering your account has been completely drained and as for me it was the only money I had and then to not have it and then hoping that Credit Karma would take care of it, give me back my money, and make it an easy going process, but instead they going against what we are telling them, they deny our disputes and just make it almost impossible to ever even get any of your money back. Something has to be done to stop this because Ive read a lot of reviews about the same or similar situation and they do this to everyone.

2. Have at least ten ( 10 ) electronic transactions post to the account within 120 days of account opening. 

I did not understand the meaning of Average Collected Balance and the branch manager at the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, explained that it simply means money deposited and not later returned. XXXX XXXX confirmed that I may deposit a check and that the first day of the 120 days would be on the day that the check is deposited. 

I opened the account on XX/XX/XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX XXXX again confirmed that the check deposit would be day one of the 120 days period. I deposited a check for {$10000.00} at account opening. 

There was an issue with a charge on the account that was corrected on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX confirmed that the average collected balance would be above the required {$10000.00} [ for the {$600.00} bonus ] if the current balance was held until the end of the 120 days ( Exhibit 2 ). 

My statements ( Exhibit 3 ) show the {$10000.00} deposit on XX/XX/XXXX, eleven electronic transactions ( XXXX ) and an average balance above {$10000.00} until XX/XX/XXXX ( 123 days ). However, the bonus payout on XX/XX/XXXX was only {$400.00} instead of the expected {$600.00}. 

XXXX XXXX investigated the issue of the reduced payout and found out that he himself had received incorrect information from the bank, and that the information that he had provided in turn was incorrect. Apparently, BMO did not start the 120 days clock on the day that the check was deposited but at some later date. I assume when BMO lifted the check hold? This is not even shown on the statement! The calculated average balance was therefore somewhere between $ XXXX {$10000.00} and this only qualified for the {$400.00} bonus ( See Exhibit 1 ). 

XXXX XXXX was very sorry for the incorrect information he had provided, and he and his manager requested that I receive the missing {$200.00} for the full {$600.00} bonus ( Exhibit 4 ).

( Name Removed ) went on to say not to call him via phone, best way contact him would be by email. I immediately called my XXXX branch to verify his status with XXXX. I was passed from person to person no one could verify who he was. I was transferred to commercial loan dept and spoke with a nice woman, ( Name Removed ) she said she would look into it and let me know. I did not get a response back from her so a few days later I called her back and was told she was able to locate this man and that he was a real VP of XXXX in Florida Commercial Loan Dept. This woman ( Name Removed ) also emailed me a copy of what she found regarding the loan, ( see item B ). 

I, again, asked ( Name Removed ) for more information and a copy of the loan. In the beginning ( Name Removed ) stated the loan was for {$10000.00}. ( Name Removed ) finally sent us a copy of the loan agreement, ( see item C ) and it WAS the loan we thought it was. We tried to explain that we had never been late or missed a payment so why was this happening? All he would say is ( Name Removed, can I expect payoff this week? ( see item D ). Unfortunately, I was shocked to see he wanted this paid this week. After receiving that request I sat down and tried to figure out about what I could comfortably pay. ( see item XXXX ) which says : Just a quick email to let you know, I have assessed my finances and we are able to pay {$150.00} to {$200.00} per month with no issues. Please let us, if acceptable, know how we can get this started. You are welcome to check our accounts to verify our income and payments. As you can see my property tax went from {$500.00} + to now over {$800.00} a month. 

( Name Removed ) came back with ( see item F ). which says, ( Name Removed ), that's not going to work. We need paid with next 60 days at the most I can give you. The companies out of business. This is not a consumer debt, its commercial and there are rules and guidelines we have to follow especially when the company is out of business. You need to talk to family and friends finance companies etc. Let me know y XX/XX/XXXX. Thanks ( see item G ) for my response, which says Unfortunately, as I stated previously, I have no funds available the only way possible to pay this off is to make payments. Fifth Third is and has been my financial Institution. Production Turning, being closed since Covid still made the payments on the loan and when the payments stopped I assumed it was paid off. I need to get more details regarding that loan.

After this message from ( Name Removed ), I started to feel he was catching on to what I was saying. ( see item H ) which says Can you pay a couple thousand down and pay roughly {$600.00} over 12 months?

At this point we were going in 10 different directions trying to do what he was telling us to do trying to find out WHY this was happening. Then I received out of office responses saying he would be out of the office but would be checking his emails. ( see item I ). 

Now here is the kicker, ( Name Removed ) asked us what we could pay, since I am on limited income I told him about {$200.00} per month, he came back and said that isn't going to work and he could allow up to 60 day to pay it off and said we should contact friends, family and our financial institution for help. Well XXXX is our financial institution, but that will probably be changing very soon. WHAT, he doesn't have a very long attention span. He also said later that we could pay {$2000.00} down and then {$600.00} per month for a year. Which would equal {$9200.00}. We figured we could some how make that happen. But still wanting to know WHY. Then ( Name Removed ) completely ruined us!!! Caused us sever embarrassment. On XX/XX/XXXX I opened my personal checking account online to see that over {$7000.00} had been transferred out of my personal checking account. I am XXXX years old and really thought I was headed to the hospital. We have most of our bills on auto pay because we really trusted XXXX. They are all being kicked back to my creditors, my electric, cell phone, gas, XXXX XXXX XXXX and my loyal, wonderful bank is charging me overdrafts and late fees and when the money ran out of my checking they emptied my savings All of this happened so fast, changed constantly, and I didn't know what was going on then to loose over {$9000.00} on a loan that was not in default nor did it mature until XXXX of XXXX. But it just gets better from there. We had about {$1800.00} left in ( Name Removed ) business account and guess what poof it was taken also. 


This is NO WAY to show loyalty to your loyal customers. Now, you have caused me to look like a loser to my monthly payees. I am totally embarrassed and humiliated. Why did this happen Here is something else that XXXX did not do their job. On this loan when the first payment was mad via auto pay, I noticed the payment was only {$85.00} and went back to the branch spoke with XXXX, manager at the time at the ( Name Removed ) Branch. I explained that we would never get it paid off at that rate and was told she would take care of it I asked for an additional {$200.00} to come out. XXXX said ok. Next month noticed another {$80.00} was taken out nothing more. So I called and explained to the girl on the phone what had happened she said ( Name Removed ) no longer works there and she couldn't do it because it is a commercial loan and referred me to ( Name Removed ) the new manager. Spoke with him said he would check into it and get back to me. Next month same thing, I let it go a few months no change called again, was told ( Name Removed ) no longer worked there and I needed to speak to ( Name Removed ). what a mess. Oh and ( Name Removed ) was only there a very short time too. 


I was not allowed to transfer money into it because it had to be auto paid. I tried several times to add money to this loan ... ..no one would help. So that is why it is such a low amount. 

In summarizing this experience : ( Name Removed ), I do not know what to do! I am totally shocked over all of this. I am reaching out to you to find out why and how this came about and how it can be fixed. I certainly do not know how I can ever trust Fifth Third Bank again. 

This is what has happened to my bank accounts ; I had {$7000.00} taken. Once that was emptied, I see my savings account was transferred out to pay for overdrafts. WHAT that was {$910.00} and wasn't my doing. So far lost {$7900.00}. Someone must have noticed there was money in my XXXX account {$1700.00} and decided to grab that too. They did however credit back some interest and I have {$32.00} left. Making the total taken from me me {$9600.00}. So far. 

Some of my questions are : How was I given 60 days and then 13 days later I was broke? 
I was even offered {$2000.00} down and {$600.00} a month for over 12 months??? 
Don't your offices work together? One says one thing and the other does something completely different. Someone needs a lot more training!! 
Why was I not notified of the pending disaster? 
Why was a lawyer involved? 
Why did a man from Florida, ( Name Removed ) deal with my account? 
Why was my local branch not aware of this? 

FACTS : Loan was on auto pay Options offered by ( Name Removed ) kept changing.

Loan not in default Never a late payment! 
Loan to be paid off by XX/XX/XXXX I appreciate the time you have spent on the above issues. I feel I am one of your more loyal customers and look forward to your response regarding this problem.

05/04/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I noticed a reoccurring charge of {$150.00} for a XXXX subscription that occurs in XX/XX/2023, the same time as many other charges that happen during holiday shopping. I knew this should not be since I already pay for a XXXX subscription that occurs as a monthly charge and is a legacy bundle, so the price should be cheaper than the yearly price I am charged. 

Speaking to XXXX, the company that was used for online shopping, XXXX, the merchant in question, and Chase XXXX the bank that holds my credit card, we eventually came to the conclusion that the payments have been made in the past and are using my XXXX account for this account. I do not access to it, nor do I know who would, but is not set to my current home address or previous home address and the account is using my funds to pay that unknown subscription. So both Chase and XXXX have concluded that the account must be fraudulent. In this case, XXXX immediately cancelled the questionable subscription and cancelled the payment as well. 

These talks, however, did not include so much of XXXX help. In the time from XXXX to early XXXX, XXXX has not helped in gathering any sort of information to reach said conclusion. In fact, they were not able to provide any information except stating that the reoccurring annual charges have been present for at least 2 years and each time, the amount had been paid. They were unhelpful with any forms of communication with me and my bank, giving conflicting and misleading information that dragged investigations on much longer than needed. 

For example, they would continually not give any information to myself stating only my bank ( Chase ) was allowed to contact them to get sensitive information. However, when Chase would contact them, they stated they could not talk to them because the information pertaining to me was sensitive information and they could not disclose this to anyone except myself. And when I would contact XXXX again stating everything they have told myself and Chase, they would repeat what they said earlier : they can not talk to me and will only disclose information with my card holder Chase. And this circling of information would continue over and over again. 

Another example, when I had called Chase enough times stating the contradicting information from above, Chase would conference me into a call with XXXX. The first phone number Chase was left with from XXXX was actually to another bank that had no affiliation to my XXXX account or my payment history. The second time, the XXXX agent then tried to hang up and tell me to call back without the Chase agent because they could not disclose my bank information with another party present, even though it was the bank in question. And when they reluctantly agreed to have a conversation with the two of us present, they said they could not look into the payment information of the charge in question because I/we needed to speak with the merchant who is demanding the payment and would not look into the matter themselves. When trying to ask why they would not or why they have not, they would shut down the conversation and proceed to hang up. A future call to them with a different agent had the line immediately disconnect as soon as they picked up, which would happen if the XXXX agent consciously hung up on us. All Chase agents who were helping me with the case all noted how unhelpful XXXX was being during the investigation. 

But even in the very end with speaking with all parties, XXXX would not disclose any helpful information in a possibility of a fraudulent purchase. And with XXXX not disclosing any information, Chase refused to move forward, even with their own evidence showing XXXX stonewalling, avoiding conversations, and even lying about forms of communication. What makes the investigation between both parties even more frustrating is that, without my intervention, neither institution would speak to the merchant that was supposedly asking for money XXXX. 

Through the investigation, I spoke with XXXX agents over and over again over the same unknown account. Although they have a policy where they can not disclose the information about the account ( except that they are using my payment method for their account ), and they have another policy that they can not disclose any written information and therefore must contact XXXX for their own notes on the case, they did say they were open for communication for the case and provided me with case numbers that could be used to refer back to their notes taken on the case. And each time I tried to speak to XXXX and Chase to provide the information I gathered from XXXX and even provide the case numbers for our conversation ( and even took screenshots of an online text conversation with a XXXX agent before the chat was closed and deleted on my end ), neither XXXX or Chase would take my information and contact XXXX to learn more from the company rather than myself, a biased 3rd party that could potentially provide skewed information that would need to be looked into anyway which would ultimately lead to the opening talks with XXXX if they actually followed through in their investigations. But XXXX  said, again, they would only speak with the bank. And Chase would not take the information I provided, stating it was not enough to go off of and would only accept information from XXXX and that XXXX should contact them. 

In the end, in the very end of all this at the early part of XXXX, I tried to appeal to say that at the very least, I should not be charged for the one annual charge in XXXX because XXXX is no longer asking for that money. The moment the investigation opened up on a fraud account, the fee was cancelled ( and the account was closed ). When I tried to tell this information to XXXX, they stated that this was a matter then between myself and my bank as XXXX is a 3rd party that does not handle money directly and only sends payment requests to banks. Chase, however, states that the request has been made by XXXX who is acting on behalf of XXXX and XXXX has demanded the money and with the current way these transactions are handled, Chase has already paid XXXX and therefore XXXX is responsible for cancelling the payment and/or returning the money. And just like before, when trying to relay what one says about the other, both parties refuse to move forward in the investigation until one opens communication with the other. And from there, neither of them have tried to contact the other and I have been left with a fraud case against my credit. 

After 4 tiring months of investigation with neither Chase nor XXXX offering proper help for a charge that has obvious signs of fraud tied to it, I could not get either side to help me with my financial crisis. To protect my credit, I dropped communication with both sides, paid the amount due on my card, and removed my card information from the XXXX account ( it is still alive to continue to have access to payment history with that account ) and have locked away the card to no longer be used in the future ( I do not have a bank account with Chase, so I am cutting ties with them as much as I can without harming my credit ).

05/19/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Two Dispute issues : 1. I ordered a book from a book retailer called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ). The XXXX XXXX *cancelled* the book and ALL ORDERS from book retailers were ALSO cancelled. I provided a statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX  that was available to the public stating that all orders were cancelled. I also provided an e-mail from a 2nd book retailer supporting my point that when the PUBLISHER cancels all orders the RETAILERS *must* follow suit ( they cancelled a separate order I put in ). However, ONE YEAR LATER, the publisher RE-SOLICITED the same book. Every other retailer had to take and enter NEW orders for this solicitation. But THIS one book retailer took it upon themselves to use my previously-but-now-cancelled charge approval and went ahead and applied to a NEW charge on the NEW solicitation of the book. The bookseller charged me and sent the book... even tho "" the charge was meant to ONLY be applied to a now-cancelled product. I tried to return it ; the retailer wouldn't accept it ( the book was unopened, as was the box it came in ). Discover Card sided w/the book seller, even though I sent demonstrable proof that my approval can not and should not have been applied to a wholly new order, no matter that it was for the same item at the same price. Simply put, I gave NO approval for this charge, only for the PREVIOUSLY ( cancelled ) charge. 
********* XXXX. My web hosting company, a group called XXXX, was hosting my websites for several years. Recently, I cancelled all of the hosting. There was a {$21.00} charge put on my Discover card in advance of the renewal ( a standard practice at web hosts so that users like me don't have an interruption in service ). I contacted XXXX XXXX customer service and asked them to reverse the "" in advance '' charge b/c I wasn't certain I'd be renewing my services with them. They said "" No problem '' and told me the charge was reversed. When I check my card activity, I see that XXXX XXXX only credited me {$11.00}. I disputed the remaining {$10.00} with Discover and also contacted XXXX XXXX about this. XXXX XXXX told me it was surcharge for the last-minute change of mind, but I explained that their own cancel rules indicate I cancelled early enough to not be taxed w/the {$10.00} charge. They agreed to look into it further and, a few weeks later, refunded me the {$10.00}. SEVERAL weeks after that, Discover Card went ahead and randomly ADDED THE FULL {$21.00} back to my balance! There's NO reason for that -- Blue Host refunded me. But, in spite of the evidence again, Discover card sided w/the retailer, in spite of their being NO charge to side with them on. 
********* This CLEARLY indicates a pattern of behavior at Discover Card where Discover is purposefully siding with retailers to ensure they get to keep whatever percentage of these charges that they make THEIR money from. They stealing from consumers, and I will be you they have been doing this FOR YEARS and that there are XXXX of Discover Card consumers whose Disputes were ILLEGALLY found in favor of the store and NOT the consumer JUST SO Discover can be sure to keep that small percentage of money which, of course, piles up to hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars a year! 
XXXX  I would like to formally request that the CFPB not just research MY disputes but investigate the Discover Card company for FRAUD. I am 100 % certain you will find XXXX of cases of this fraud on the part of Discover Card over the last WHO KNOWS how many years. 
XXXX  Another, separate, example of Discover Card fraud : I put my credit card on "" frozen '' status after a number of the errors so that I didn't use it any longer, but I left it as frozen ( as opposed to cancelling it ) just in case there was an autopayment that I missed. Well, while at the website eBay, I apparently accidentally chose the Discover card for 2 recent payments. Now, when the card is "" Frozen '' ONLY autopayments ( like phone bill or gas, etc. ) are supposed to post ; everything else is supposed to be rejected, so this is another fraud being perpetrated by them. 
XXXX Now, I did make those purchases and accidentally choosing the Discover card is MY fault, but the fact that my card was "" XXXX '' and the charges went through? That's a HUGE red flag ... and supports my point that Discover does NOT want to protects its customers but rather wants to wring as much money as possible out of its credit card users. Once more, I implore your organization to do a full, deep, and VERY detailed investigation. There is no doubt something rotten here!

This card was tied to a transferred account from my mother, who passed away in XXXX XXXX ( see attached death certificate ). The timing of the transfer occurred in XXXX timeframe as her estate was being settled. 

Upon attempting to make my reservations online, I received an on-line "" XXXX XXXX '' notice requesting a verification code for input. However, the verification code was being sent to my deceased mother 's old cell phone. I called Amex to inform them of their error, they acknowledged that they had all of my personal information, including my current cell phone, but security purposes, could only send the verification code to my deceased mother 's old cell phone number.

I am writing to dispute an unauthorized automatic payment of {$56.00} to my debit card account on XX/XX/XXXX by Ally Credit Card. 
The charge is in error because : 1. I never enrolled in autopay and Ally Credit Card doesn't have my authorization to debit my bank account 2. The amount of the payment is also wrong. My due amount was {$0.00} at the time. On XX/XX/XXXX ( a week before my due date ), I paid the entire current balance of {$270.00} ( while my statement balance was {$170.00} ) This brings any "" Remaining statement balance '' down to {$0.00}, and on my due date on the XXXX, I owed nothing. 

EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED I have had an Ally Credit Card since XX/XX/XXXX, with a line of credit of {$300.00}, and a due day on the XXXX of each month. 
I have never set up an autopay. I make manual payments, always paying off my card in full shortly before the due date. 
This XXXX I also paid earlier and in full ( the current balance ). On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$270.00} ( which was processed as usual and by the XXXX I was using my card again ) However, after XX/XX/XXXX my card unexpectedly declined and my account showed that it was placed on hold. By checking my recent transactions Ive learned that on XX/XX/XXXX Ally tried to debit my bank account for some additional payment in the amount of {$56.00}. But since I never authorized an autopay, the payment wasn't honored and showed as returned. Upon which Ally concluded that my bank account was frozen and placed my card on hold. 

Too, Ally never sent any prior notice about the upcoming payment or the ballance due, and my account app never showed any ballance due either. It was comletely out of blue and came as a shock. 

I contacted XXXX Customer Service numerous times but they wouldn't do anything about it. They instantly dismissed any possibility of the error on their end, and bluntly insisted that the information in my account was correct. They were completely ignorant of what I was saying, solely relying on the info in my account kept telling me that I failed to make this payment for {$56.00} that it didn't get through because my bank account was frozen (! ) and that I need a different bank account to pay the balance or my card will remain on hold. I spoke with XXXX different Customer Service representatives, including the Customer Service Supervisor ( who was especially arrogant ) before giving up on trying to resolve this issue over the phone.

My first statement closed on XX/XX/XXXX and I paid it in full on XX/XX/XXXX, so I could start charging purchases to the card again towards the {$3500.00} requirement.

05/15/24,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Subject : Complaint Against Discover Card for Unfair Account Closure and Negative Credit Reporting Dear Sir/Madam , I am writing to file a formal complaint against Discover Card regarding their handling of my credit card account, which I believe constitutes unfair and potentially illegal practices. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Discover Card stating, "" We have taken this action because we were unable to verify personal information on your account. We will report to the credit bureaus that the account was closed by creditor, and credit your account with your card rewards balance if you have one. '' This action was taken without prior notice or any attempt to contact me for verification of my identity. 

Here are the specific issues I have encountered : Lack of Prior Notification and Verification Request : At no point did Discover Card communicate with me to request any form of identification or verification of personal information. I opened this account on XX/XX/XXXX, and have been making timely payments on this account for several months, indicating my active and responsible management of the account. 

Unwarranted Account Closure : Discover Card closed my account on the grounds of unverifiable personal information without providing an opportunity for me to address or correct the issue. This closure was abrupt and unjustified given my payment history and consistent account activity. 

Negative Impact on Credit Report : Despite claiming an inability to verify my personal information, Discover Card has reported the account closure to credit bureaus, indicating that the account was closed by the creditor. This action negatively impacts my credit score and overall credit history, which is particularly troubling since I have not been delinquent or irresponsible with my payments. 

Extenuating Circumstances : In XX/XX/XXXX, I was hospitalized with XXXX for 10 days and spent months recovering from related health issues. I have documentation to verify this if needed. Additionally, I had to return to the emergency room on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, due to complications from my illness. Due to my hospitalization and recovery, I missed the XXXX payment. Upon resuming my financial activities, I discovered that Discover Card had closed my account. 

It is perplexing and concerning that Discover Card can claim they are unable to verify my personal information while simultaneously having enough information to report to the credit bureaus. Furthermore, at no time did Discover Card reach out to me to request any form of identification or verification to resolve this issue. 

Given the above points, I believe Discover Card 's actions are not only unfair but potentially in violation of consumer protection laws. As a responsible consumer, I should have been afforded the opportunity to verify my information before any adverse action was taken against my account. Additionally, if they were truly unable to verify my personal information, it raises the question of how they could report accurately to credit bureaus.",,DISCOVER BANK,NC,28027,,Consent provided,Web,05/15/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9012716,"The consumer's Discover Card account was closed due to unverifiable personal information without prior notice or verification requests.

Here is a link to the product and website. 
XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX 2 ) I did not receive the merchandise, so after several weeks of waiting I reached out to merchant to inquire about the status of my order and shipment.

3 ) I was informed that the items were delivered so I asked for tracking information since I did not receive the items. Based on the tracking information provided by the merchant, XXXX customer service, the items were delivered to an address in New York and not in XXXX XXXX, Texas. 

4 ) I asked that replacements be sent, but they told me now they are out of stock so I requested refund and was told a refund would be issued. 

5 ) After not receiving the refund and after the merchant stopped responded to my email inquiries about the refund, I disputed the charge with American Express. 

6 ) The merchant provided information to American Express including a new tracking number showing that item was delivered on XX/XX/year> to an address in XXXX XXXX, Texas but the delivery address did not get more detailed than just the City and State and did not indicate a street address. XXXX XXXX is a very large city and is part of the Greater XXXX area so a tracking number that just indicates the XXXX and State is meaningless and not helpful. Also, the merchant that submitted the documentation was not Geekfone.com but another company called BookishBunnyPillow.com and they submitted an invoice that showed different products than the skeletons. It was all very strange.

7 ) When I looked up this tracking number, the status on USPS showed that a label was created and nothing was shipped yet.

8 ) I submitted this information to American Express but the credit card company still sided with the merchant.

9 ) I called USPS and they informed me I could purchase additional historical archived information that was more detailed on that tracking number and so I did that. This was an additional charge of {$9.00} to receive this archived information.

10 ) Archived information showed that indeed some type of package was delivered to an address in XXXX XXXX, but that address was not my address, it was another address in XXXX XXXX, Texas. 

11 ) I submitted this to American Express to review the dispute again, but they again sided with the merchant stating that they can only rely on the information provided by the merchant and try to come to an amicable resolution and could not give me a refund. They said it was not their place to determine if the charge was valid or not since the merchant sent them documentation even though the documentation showed that the products were not delivered to my address.

12 ) I decided to XXXX XXXX and XXXX and found dozens of negative reviews from consumers expressing that this website was a fraud and they received either no products after purchase or deceptively marketed products and not what they expected. 

13 ) I called American Express to complain about this issue as they state that they offer 100 % fraud protection and this is indeed fraud in my mind. They said they could not refund me, but could offer me {$500.00} in credit if I agreed to stay an American Express customer for another year.

Records show that I make payments of amounts under {$20.00} per day, and have never authorized a payment that exceeds the amount in my bank account. Citibank reps said their records showed that I had authorized it via my mobile app. Turns out, Citibank has access to my account and can make activity logs look like I authorized the payments ( most centralized banks do ). 

Citibank decided to abuse these privileges of being a centralized bank and debit money from my bank account such that it went down to XXXX dollars and went into thousands of dollars of overdraft. Thankfully my bank XXXX XXXX did not immediately release the payment to Citibank, and I was able to request a stop payment in time. XXXX XXXX also approved of my claim that the amount was not authorized by me because they saw the consistent daily payments to Citibank in the amounts of under {$20.00} per day, which didn't match the behavior of authorizing a payment of $ XXXX that would set my account to XXXX dollars and into overdraft. 

Per XXXX XXXX, Citibank 's actions constitute fraudulent unauthorized access and payment request, and the public should know about it. No bank is perfect, but at least XXXX XXXX was more organized and quick in its handling of the situation and restored my bank account by returning the funds back to my account.

Dependence on technology and AI without considering security and access controls from the inside of the bank may very well be the cause of the downfall of Citibank. Citibank deserves their fate and its impending doom, as NY attorney general XXXX XXXX and the hundreds of thousands of customers who lost money ( and have not been made whole ) through Citibank 's data breach ( probably from lack of insider access control ) and people like myself who have experienced unauthorized activity from Citibank itself are all aware that Citibank is the most unethical big bank of them all.

Firstly, according to 15 USC 1681 section 602 ( a ) of the FCRA, it is imperative that consumer reporting agencies such as Equifax and XXXX conduct their operations with fairness, impartiality, and respect for consumers ' privacy rights. As a consumer, I am entitled to ensure that my private information remains secure, as reinforced by 15 USC 6801, which mandates financial institutions to uphold the privacy and confidentiality of customers ' nonpublic personal information.

Under 15 USC 1681 section 604 ( a ) ( 2 ), it is explicitly stated that consumer reporting agencies may only furnish consumer reports under circumstances outlined in written instructions from the consumer. I have not provided consent, neither written nor implied, for Equifax, or any furnisher of information to credit agencies to share my personal information.

Furthermore, according to 15 USC 6802 ( b ) ( c ), financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to third parties without informing consumers of their right to opt out of such disclosure. I have not been properly informed of this right by the relevant financial institution.

Additionally, the reporting of adverse items of information, such as the account in question, without my consent violates 15 USC 1681C ( a ) ( 5 ), which restricts consumer reporting agencies from including such information in consumer reports.

Moreover, 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 ( a ) ( 1 ) prohibits the furnishing of inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies, and Equifax and XXXX are failing to uphold reasonable procedures to prevent violations of the FCRA, as mandated by 15 U.S. Code 1681e.

This incident has raised serious concerns about my future ability to obtain credit. 

In accordance with the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), which stipulates that consumers have the right to request and obtain information about their accounts that have been reported, I am hereby requesting all pertinent information that your company has used as the basis for reporting my account as late. This includes, but is not limited to, payment histories, dates of alleged late payments, and any correspondence or notices sent to me regarding late payments. 

I am writing to you today regarding the above account and vigorously contesting the manner in which it is reported on my credit bureau reports. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) has given me the right to request an immediate removal of this account from my credit report as per Section 611 because the account as reported does not accurately reflect my credit liability. 

I have exhaustively reviewed my credit report prepared by all three primary credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) and have observed that the accuracy of this particular account, CAP ONE AUTO with the furnished account number, is in grave contention. Please consider this communication as my official notice of dispute. 

In accordance with FCRA provisions, specifically sections 611 and 623, your firm is bound by law to investigate my grievance without delay. While the investigation is ongoing, you are obliged to mark the disputed information as such on my credit report. 

Moreover, the dispute process demands transparency, and I would appreciate receiving a detailed record of your investigation. The FCRA grants me the right to view the method of verification you employed, entitling me to the aforementioned information.

It is imperative to note, under FCRA section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), there's a requirement that stipulates you supply accurate information about me to various reporting agencies. Misrepresenting information about my account indicates egregious violations in both letter and spirit. Therefore, an immediate remedial action is fundamental. 

Should you fail to address the inconsistencies reported with immediate effect, understand you open yourselves up to potential litigation and punitive damages, as detailed by FCRA Section 616 and 617. My right as a consumer, when infringed upon, carries a cost that your institution would be held liable for, this includes attorney fees. 

Please understand that I am acting in utmost good faith to rectify discrepancies in my credit report that have occurred through no fault of my own, rather as a result of inaccuracies reported by your firm. I look for nothing more than the legal requirement for accurate credit reporting, as stipulated by the FCRA, and hope your immediate investigation into this matter will correct these inaccuracies and so mitigate any damage done to my credit standing and personal reputation. 

I hereby request immediate removal of the account in question from my credit report, to reflect the actual state of my financial dealings accurately. Furthermore, you are required to provide a summary of your investigation and the steps taken for rectification. 

Please note that a copy of this letter is being sent to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and my attorney to maintain a record of my dispute. A definitive response to this dispute is expected within 30 days from the receipt of this letter, as required by the law.

I formally dispute the validity of this alleged debt. My dispute of this debt will be sent to Consumer Adjustment Co electronically, via CFPBs portal, and to the address referenced above, via certified mail, for record keeping purposes. 

In violation of both FCRA and FDCPA, I never received any notice of this alleged debt, with all of the required components, or of my right to dispute. However, as of XX/XX/2024, this alleged and fraudulent collection account was reported to my credit report. I do not owe this debt or any debt to Consumer Adjustment Co. or to any third party Consumer Adjustment Co. is stating to represent. I was a victim of identity theft and had a plethora of accounts fraudulently opened in my name. I have, again, enclosed a copy of FTCs id theft report to this letter.

As it is apparent that this alleged account was opened fraudulently, it is unconscionable that Consumer Adjustment Co. chose to initiate credit reporting and collection efforts, without giving me my legal right to dispute.

Per FCRA and FDCPA, all reportable information has to be true and accurate prior to reporting. Consumer Adjustment Co. has failed to follow the law and has taken adverse action against me and my credit report, by placing a collection account on my credit report, which was opened by way of fraud, without giving me proper notification and my right to dispute. 

As such, I formally request that all adverse information placed against my credit report is removed immediately upon receipt of my documentation, and that further collection activities are ceased. You are also notified that should adverse information remain on my credit reports, and if collection activities continue, appropriate legal action will be taken.

I believe that my personal information has been mishandled, leading to a breach of privacy and potential harm to my financial well-being.

Firstly, I have reason to believe that my FCRA rights have been violated due to inaccurate information reported by a credit reporting agency. The FCRA mandates that credit reporting agencies maintain accurate and up-to-date information about consumers, and that consumers have the right to dispute any inaccuracies. I have discovered several errors in my credit report, including incorrect account balances and outdated information, which have adversely affected my creditworthiness. Despite my repeated attempts to rectify these errors, the credit reporting agency has failed to take appropriate action, thereby violating my FCRA rights.

Furthermore, I suspect a violation of my 4th Amendment rights in relation to unauthorized access and use of my personal information. I have reason to believe that certain entities have obtained and utilized my personal data without my knowledge or consent. This unauthorized access to my information not only infringes upon my right to privacy but also exposes me to potential identity theft and financial harm. I am deeply concerned about the potential consequences of this violation and the lack of safeguards in place to protect consumers ' sensitive information. 

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau thoroughly investigate this matter to ensure that my rights under the FCRA and the 4th Amendment are upheld. I urge you to take appropriate action against the credit reporting agency responsible for the inaccurate reporting and the entities involved in the unauthorized access and use of my personal information. 

Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide in rectifying the inaccuracies in my credit report and safeguarding my personal information from further misuse. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will diligently work towards resolving this violation and protecting consumers ' rights.

05/02/24,Debt or credit management,Debt settlement,Didn't provide services promised,,"In XXXX of last year, my wife and I decided to consolidate credit card debt. Right around that time, we received a flyer in the mail from a company named XXXX XXXX, promising interest rates as low as XXXX XXXX on a consolidation loans. 

We talked about it and gave them a call. Unfortunately, it didnt connect us with XXXX XXXX, which I questioned numerous times, it connected us with Level One Law, who said we didnt qualify for the low interest loan and they were willing to lend us money to consolidate the debt for XXXX % points below what the credit cards were charging. At hearing that, my XXXX  and both declined the offer. The smooth-talking gentleman explained they could settle our debt down and it would take XXXX months for the entire process and everything would be finished At the time ( approximately XX/XX/XXXX ) when we signed with Level One Law, we were not behind or late on any of our debt and only sought to consolidate credit card debt in anticipation of my possible retirement in XX/XX/XXXX. At the time, our credit ratings hovered at or near the mid-upper XXXX. Today is it at of hovering around the XXXX range. 

We began making monthly payments or {$1100.00} monthly in XX/XX/XXXX. Since the day we signed with Level One Law, they have not been provided ANY debt relief actions on or behalf what-so-ever. No communication, no calls, no court appearances and no documents filed on our behalf, until after XXXX XXXX XXXX was placed into receivership by the courts on or about XX/XX/XXXX. Every time contacted Level One Law, we were told you dont have enough in your account to settle your debt. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, I called Level One Law and was insistent on speaking to a supervisor or XXXX. After over XXXX hours on the phone with Level One Law, I was told we only had approximately {$5000.00} in our account. Up until that time, we had deposited over {$13000.00} into our account. This includes payments we made in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, totaling just under {$2400.00}, which was after the courts had stopped/restricted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX transaction from taking place until all legal matters were settled. 

On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, I received an email notice from Level One Law explaining fraud that was committed by a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX. This company was ultimately determined to be the company the payments were going to. This email was received a full XXXX months after the courts placed them in receivership, and not being notified until we had made XXXX additional payments to Level One Law. 

My understanding of the situation is, indicates the monthly payments were drawn out or our local bank account and transferred to an account at XXXX XXXX ( a legal company ), in XXXX Oklahoma. Once the funds were received by XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX withdrew the money out and transferred it to XXXX companies. Once the money was received into the XXXX XXXXompanies, XXXX XXXX XXXX took the funds for services that had not yet been provided to the clients of Level One Law, thus creating the circumstances and legal actions by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Ultimately, the courts to placed XXXX XXXX XXXX into receivership on or about XX/XX/XXXX, resulting in restricting or stopping further business until the courts could settle all legal matters. 

By our best estimate, XXXX XXXX XXXX, over the course of the first XXXX  months, took approximately XXXX % of the funds we had sent to settle debt without ever providing the service of Level One Law, even though we had a locally assigned Level One Law attorney appointed. 

This has caused our debt go into default and it was sold to XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, a local debt collection firm, who now seeks that we make monthly payments to settle the debt amount. 

I believe Level One Law is a conspirator in the fraud that occurred with XXXX XXXX XXXX, due to then lack of legal representation from Level One Law over the course of a year. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, my XXXX  and I decided to address the debt ourselves and contacted XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 
I was told by the representative of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX that they couldnt speak to me because I had a local assigned attorney ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, who filed the paperwork on or about XX/XX/XXXX ( almost 3 months to the day after they XXXX XXXX XXXX was implicated in the fraud ), indicating he was my attorney of record. This action was taken approximately XXXX months after being appointed as our attorney by Level One Law and after the legal actions had been taken against XXXX XXXX XXXX. Due to lack of legal representation by Level One Law, I believe it indicates they may be coconspirators with XXXX XXXX XXXX in the fraud that occurred. 

Unfortunately, it appears XXXX XXXX was in such a hurry to file the court documents, he failed to put my XXXX XXXX name on the document/s he filed with the courts ( according to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ). 

When my XXXX called XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, they told her they called the Level One Law attorney, XXXX XXXX, numerous times and he never returned any of their calls. They also told her that there is no attorney assigned on her behalf from Level One Law. 

Over the entire time we signed with Level One Law, we never received any correspondence, calls, emails or any other type of correspondence from XXXX XXXX. On XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX I received the first and only communication ever received from XXXX XXXX, who admitted he filed the court documents after finding out about the XXXX XXXX XXXX notice of receivership, which makes me believe Level One Law may be a coconspirator in the fraud. 

During my conversation with XXXX XXXX, he stated other attorneys quit working for Level One Law and he felt a duty as the only attorney representing Level XXXX clients in the state of XXXX XXXX He also said he felt so bad he would represent my XXXX and myself for free, which I did not accept. 

I believe his late filing of court documents is an attempt to stave off any legal actions against Level One Law because, theres no reason why he hadnt filed court documents on our behalf within the previous year. 

I personally uploaded the court documents we were served with onto the Level One Laws website, which the website will show the documents were received and are stored and in their possession. 

Before the fraud was discovered and addressed by the courts and, before being notified by Level One Law over XXXX months after all business transactions on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX, were limited and/or stopped by the federal courts. 


I can provide any documents to show that the fraud that was committed has severely damaged our credit and put my XXXX and my job in jeopardy, and put us in a situation that will most likely force us to pay debt until the day we die, which was NEVER our intention to start with. 

Please do a business license search in XXXX XXXX for Level One Law and/or the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX "" supposed owner '' of Level One Law.

We have been with this company since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX was our first contact and then we began talking to XXXX because they were the attorney group handling everything. 

I have been handling this mess of XXXX debt since then. I was surprised and I was skeptical as the website shows our paid debt still shows three of our debt pieces in presettlement. All from the same vendor. I got this individuals personal phone number and name and have had several conversations with him. The attorney chatted with me 3 times as I wanted confirmation of this completion in writing and I can not get anyone on the phone at canyon. 

Then my ex-husband received something in email that we needed to sign that said we would get our fees back because of this lawsuit happening and that we should sign it. I called the attorney again and he explained what it was and that he was supposed to get all of these signed and answer questions. We are at the end of our program and the payment changes won't affect us as we are done. I told my ex to sign it and unfortunately he did not download a copy of what he signed. 

I talked with the attorney again as he said that someone should be calling to tell us what happens now that we are finished and, that if no one has called as of XX/XX/XXXX, that we should call him back. I have called XXXX and no one answers. So I just called him back todayhe just answered me. 

This attorney is the only one I can get a hold of. During that call last month, he suggested we call Global Holdings ( XXXX acct ) and tell them they do not have authority to take any more draws out of our acct monthly. He said that should take care of the remaining debt as we are done paying and the rest of the draws to the vendor are enough to pay everything off by XXXX. 

I am nervous about this as we were trying to do the right thing by taking care of the debt issue with a consolidation company to help us with the credit debt we had. 

What do I do if they are lying? I need some help. The last vendor we are dealing with is XXXX XXXX. Payments scheduled to them go until XX/XX/XXXX. Global shows draft payments continuing to be drawn out until XX/XX/XXXX.

Good credit, substantial credit line, but just making minimum payments. Little knowledge of resources/ options, randomly 'cold-called ' XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for advice, & after dizzying series of transfers indicating no, no, no, ended up on line with JG Wentworth, which said yes, yes, yes, & painted a glowing picture of becoming debt-free in 6 months +/-. 

It was a great sales pitch, asked all? XXXX that came to mind such as the role of the Company, charges for services, wise to stop making Credit Card payments. All deflected - more information provided in future 'Welcome Call, ' Agreement sent, important to sign now, cursory review of headings, you can read the details later, and I signed, agreeing to pay $ XXXX month, from XX/XX/XXXX > XX/XX/XXXX - at which time I would be XXXX years old - to settle debt of about {$43000.00} +/-. 

This was presented as a US government program, created with creditors, and that JG Wentworth, would enter into direct negotiations to get me the best deal possible, as quickly as possible. I was not told in any coherent manner that the percentages of payments were basically stipulated in the governing authorization for the program, nor that payments to creditors would be sequential, based on the funds I deposited with JG Wentworth, nor that my credit rating would crater, that I would continue to be charged interest until an 'Agreement ' was in place, that monthly Credit Crd fees would also be added, and that I would ultimately lose the ability to use the Credit Cards enrolled in the program, and likely jeopardize remaining cards as well. I was also not told for months that JG Wentworth would take 25 % of the original amount of the debt as a fee for service. 

This last only became apparent when the first Credit Card debt was settled : Original balance - {$4.00}, balance at Settlement - {$4500.00} ( including {$440.00} additional interest ), Settlement- {$2200.00} ( 50 % ) + {$1000.00} JG Wentworth fee. This represents a payment of about 81 % of the original debt, an amount that I could easily have paid off without the 'assistance ' of JG Wentworth. 

Throughout this period many calls for clarification, all 'helpful ' and 'encouraging, prompting me to continue with the Wentworth program until I finally learned through a Wentworth Team member, on or about XX/XX/XXXX that yes, I could likely have obtained equivalent or better results by dealing directly with the Credit Card Company . I was encouraged to try with the next lowest balance Credit Card, and in one short call had reached an agreement to bring that account current, and to ultimately retain the use of the card. It was uplifting, but also horrifying to realize that I had trusted JG Wentworth to act on my behalf when it wasn't necessary, and that I had essentially been driven into humiliating Credit Card default by the JG Wentworth Program. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I wrote to JG Wentworth requesting cancellation of my participation in their Program, and requesting the return of the {$630.00} on deposit with them, and, in light of the overall experience with them, a refund of the XXXX fee they had taken to 'resolve ' the debt with the afore-mentioned Credit Card company . In response I received two Voice Message regarding re-initiating the Program, and have received nothing in writing, other than a Confirmation of Cancellation. 
I have not received a refund of the funds on deposit with them, although the balance in my account now appears as {$0.00}. 

Please help, and let this serve as a cautionary tale for others. I have now learned, through conversations with the CFPB that a more logical option might have been consolidation and full-repayment of my debt or time, something that it appears would have protected my credit, and my integrity.

05/16/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"Between XXXX and XX/XX/year>, Cash App authorized XXXX fraudulent charges, totalling {$1000.00}, to be paid from my account. There were also XXXX similar transactions that were either declined ( XXXX @ {$870.00} ), canceled ( XXXX @ {$58.00} ), refunded ( XXXX @ {$190.00} ), or NSF ( XXXX @ {$210.00} ). Not one of these transactions were mine. 

On XX/XX/year>, I attempted to pay my monthly XXXX XXXX subscription and was blocked from doing so on Cash App, even after I was asked if I was authorizing this payment. I had to purchase XXXX XXXX XXXX  for {$15.00} and use that to pay it. I was going to call Cash App in the morning to address the problem. Before calling, I checked my Cash App account and found that almost {$700.00} of my money was gone, leaving a little more than a dollar in my account. Checking over the transactions since the previous night, I found that between XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX, there were XXXX transactions for {$2.00} or {$5.00} to XXXX and XXXX amounting to {$680.00}. 

I called Cash App. The rep, after putting me on hold for about XXXX min while he researched it, eventually told me to cancel my card and order another, but there wasn't anything else he could do. I did cancel the card. I called again and this rep told me to file a dispute ( why wasn't I told that ), and that it would be quicker and easier for me to do it through the app. Not true. It took me XXXX min to dispute just XXXX transaction. Another call had the woman telling me the same, but she couldn't help me without the exact date, time, amount, and vendor for each charge. She wouldn't put me through to a supervisor. The final rep I spoke to said none of these things and took about XXXX min to file the dispute for me. 

My claim was dismissed because I had in app authorization for the merchant. '' I was told it was due to my subscription. I called them again and was put through to a supervisor, XXXX ( but spelled differently ). He listened and seemed understanding and sympathetic. Once again my claim was dismissed for the same reason.

I then attempted to file a complaint against Cash App through their portal but was denied, told to file a police report, and virtually hung up on. I also contacted XXXX and they had no information to give me, but told me how to check all of my accounts through XXXX. None of them show any of these charges on my accounts.

Eventually, I decided to file a complaint with the FDIC, and went through my whole Cash App account to verify facts, etc. That's when I found out the extent of these XXXX scam payments. They started in XXXX XXXX XXXX. I hadn't noticed ant discrepancies in my balance, so never had a need to check my transactions. You'll note that most of these charges were declined, or in some cases, refunded immidiately. I don't know why, and no one will tell me. 

At that time, I did in fact, file a complaint against Cash App with the XXXX Police Department, case number XXXX. Again I called Cash App with this new information and was shut down.

Throughout this time, none of my actual purchases were affected, except one. I find it absolutely absurd that the only one of my authorized purchases that Cash App blocked was for my monthly subscription charge to XXXX XXXX, the basis of them dismissing my dispute!

As I said, none of these payments went to any of my accounts. Cash App paid them, so they should have the account info that got the money, as well as XXXX, especially since they refunded some. But then suddenly {$680.00}, in less than an hour and a half, in the middle of the night, was paid out. I also have no history of these types of payments in my Cash App account, or XXXX or XXXX.

Some of the recipients were just letters, F, XXXX, etc., which should have triggered some suspicion at the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, but it did not. We closed the account and opened a new one.

They failed to see that neither the old account nor the new one were ever used for any other online transactions before or at the present time, and the debit cards were never put in use. We changed all user names and passwords for anything we had - bank account, XXXX ID, emails, etc., all I could remember of, twice. We went to the bank in person in XXXX and opened XXXX cases on the issue. Since XXXX till now I have wasted days, going to the bank, calling them on the phone, sending faxes from the bank to different departments, etc. They never got back to me on the promised and required time. It was always us that had to call them again and chase after them. They never ever told us what to do,. Each bank XXXX told us a different story. The bank clerk in XXXX, XXXX, he himself spent hours on the phone with his superiors. There was never an advice of some logical plan of actions that we supposed to take. Actually, they kept hiding info at all times. After accusing me, or someone in the family, for the fraud, it took them XXXX months until they finally said that it was my cell phone that was used for the transactions, WHICH WAS AN IMPOSSIBLITY. It took them XXXX months to advise me to file a police report, which I did, report that I provided the bank with. 

Since they said that it was my IP internet for the transactions, I contacted the internet provider and I was instructed how to go into my computer and find out all the users. I did, I make photocopies, and faxed them to the bank, via bank branch in XXXX. They had to be sent a couple of times because they claimed they did not get them. We were specifically told that departments are independent of each other and something sent to one does not automatically reach others. That, again, led to nothing. Then we were told by a XXXX representative that we should contact the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ask for help, and to go to XXXX and subpoena them for info on our account to help us with the issue. We went to the XXXX in XXXX. We were given a blue sheet and were advised to call online XXXX XXXX for advice and support. We called, and were told that they had no idea what we should do. We called a lawyer number from those they had listed. Nothing. I was told to hire a lawyer, but hiring a lawyer was to cost us way more than the aprox. {$5000.00} that we were to recover from the bank. We obtained a phone number of a lawyer from a friend, but it wasnt his specialty or area. However, he told us that the investigating police XXXX had the right and the authority to subpoena XXXX  for XXXX. It followed weeks of back and forth calls to XXXX Police XXXX, including the XXXX station. We spent hours on the phone with XXXX XXXX even went twice to XXXX XXXX XXXX It was total wasting of time. 

At the advice of a lawyer, we contacted, twice, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He said he will consider. I am still to hear from him. I filed a complaint with the XXXX, an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department XXXX XXXX Treasury. I am still waiting to hear from them, months later. 

At about the time of the hacking, our XXXX account was hacked and there was an attempt to transfer {$1200.00} to a receiver in XXXX XXXX, whose name was recorded by the XXXX. I got that info and gave it to the bank and the Police XXXX Some time in XXXX, XXXX months after the beginning of this mess, an attempt was made to charge my new debit card, online, for the amount of {$100.00}, somewhere in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX How he got that new card info, when it had never been used, remains a mystery. I really began to suspect someone within the bank system itself. I gave that info to the bank too, but they dismissed that as useless, since the transaction did not go through. After some XXXX months, they finally told us that they believed it was an inside job ( done by me or with my knowledge ) and closed the case, as they sent us the documentation on the bases of which they came to that conclusion. That info never contained the phone numbers of the hackers, which would be connected to a bank account that they should have investigated. 

Remember the XXXX checks that were to be honored by the bank, to XXXX and to XXXX? We kept receiving late fees and penalties from XXXX. We contacted XXXX by phone, and we were told that these were for not paying our taxes to the XXXX of California. We went to the bank, and they gave me a copy showing that the check was paid and when it was paid. We fax them to XXXX, and for the next few weeks those people were getting crazy, without being able to locate the check. We went back to the bank again asking how come they gave us a copy saying that it was paid, but it does not show up in my statement as being paid, and after another week of investigations the bank concluded that it was not paid, and tried to blame me for not giving instructions, for there were no such notes in the system, as if we had any control over what they wrote down. Fortunately for us, the fact that they paid the other check, to XXXX, was a proof that yes there were such instructions. And the fact that they gave us a copy of the supposed paid check, wrongly claiming that is was paid, is also a strong proof of their mistake. On XX/XX/XXXX, they acknowledge that it was their mistake, and all they offered was to give a letter of apology to XXXX, but they were to return no money to us. Wow!?!.

05/16/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Check cashing service,Fraud or scam,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, sent via U.S. Postal Service check # XXXX, written to the United States Treasury for {$3900.00}, to pay my XX/XX/XXXX estimated individual quarterly income tax payment to the IRS. This check # XXXX cleared my Wells Fargo Bank through my primary checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 


Five months later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) from the IRS stating I owed them {$4000.00} ( {$3900.00} + penalties + interest ). I called the IRS to inform them that my Wells Fargo Bank statement had a transaction record showing that WF Bank compensated my check to the IRS on XX/XX/XXXX. The IRS told me if they had cashed the check, the back would be stamped with a barcode for tracking purposes. I double-checked my Wells Fargo online portal for a visual copy ( front & back ) of check # XXXX. The only check that was not visually accessible. I then called Wells Fargo, seeking further assistance, but they could not furnish me with a copy of the front and back of check # XXXX. The bank phone representative stated there was a potential glitch with their check imaging software system, informing me that the bank statement would be enough for the IRS to resolve my issue. I contacted the IRS to explain the information Wells Fargo Bank provided. The IRS told me the issue would likely be resolved as human error, and they would put my account on hold ( to avoid accruing additional penalties & interest ) to provide time for a resolution to be concluded. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from the IRS requesting a {$4200.00} payment. I immediately called the IRS, followed by a phone call to Wells Fargo, and the same scenario occurred. The IRS requires a copy of the front and back of the check to validate the deposit, and Wells Fargo could not provide me with a copy of the check to present to the IRS for their records and reference. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited a physical Wells Fargo branch near my house to request a copy of check # XXXX in person, which they gave me a print copy of. Upon review, check # XXXX was physically signed on the back by someone other than the IRS, presenting potential fraud. I proceeded to file a claim with Wells Fargo Bank at that time ; due to various missteps on Wells Fargo 's behalf, including a delay in initiating the claim process and a lack of clear communication, claim # XXXX took place officially on XX/XX/XXXX. 


I requested Well Fargo escalate my inquiry/claim on XX/XX/XXXX. A new claim, # XXXX, was filed in place of the original one ( noted above ), with a new follow-up date of XX/XX/XXXX. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo sent me a formal letter noting that their research on my claim # XXXX was complete, and the case was closed. They disclosed that XXXX XXXX XXXX, which cashed the check, was not liable to refund {$3900.00} for check # XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX stated to Wells Fargo that due to internal policies and procedures ( information Im not privy to ) requiring prompt reporting, they are not liable for reimbursement of the fraudulent deposit. It was necessary through XXXX XXXX representation of my claim to handle and disclose this information before an anticipated due date. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from the IRS with a new balance of {$450000.00} due by XX/XX/XXXX. 


After a year of conducting my due diligence on this matter, I have been taken advantage of and run around in circles by Wells Fargo and XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I can not trust the banking institutions to protect me against fraud. XXXX  XXXX XXXX failed their fiduciary responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their customer 's deposits and validate their identity, as they released funds from my check # XXXX to the IRS to one of their account holders. I am now at a loss of ( {$3900.00} + XXXX ) = {$8500.00}.

05/18/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Fraud or scam,,"Commencing on or about XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I fell victim to a multi-layered scam operation run by XXXX XXXX XXXX which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my Navy Federal Credit Union account to fraudulent firm ( XXXX ). 
It all started rather innocently on XXXX when the scammer claimed to be the prince of XXXX and swooped into my life promising romance and adventure. Being a XXXX XXXX skepticism was a frequent companion, but his words created a compelling story that suited his situation well. Because the story was so captivating, I relaxed and allowed the seeds of trust to grow. As our virtual bond grew, he showed me a package that had been mailed to me from XXXX. I had no idea that this was only the start of a very sophisticated strategy. When he told me there was a seemingly harmless commission fee standing between me and the product, the net got tighter. 
I felt like I was getting closer to a love story with every payment. Being a XXXX XXXX every dollar was carefully thought out. 
A growing doubt crept in as the last money left my hands. Instead of the box arriving, I started to feel uneasy and like I was being watched. I started to become paranoid because I thought he was the prince of XXXX, following me around on my phone. 
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following ( i ) whether Navy Federal Credit Union did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of Navy Federal Credit Unions custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether Navy Federal Credit Union promoted the transaction ( s ) in question despite being aware of the nature of the transaction ( s ) in question ( iv ) whether Navy Federal Credit Union was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether Navy Federal Credit Union owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Navy Federal Credit Union did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether Navy Federal Credit Unions conduct was unfair ; and ( vii ) whether Navy Federal Credit Union has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me. 
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud. 
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent banker. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a blind eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, Navy Federal Credit Union must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer. 
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element. 
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that Navy Federal Credit Union did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect. 

Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the past.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,CA,92154,,Consent provided,Web,05/18/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9043190,"The consumer fell victim to a romance scam, losing a total of XXXX USD in deposits to a fraudulent firm through their Navy Federal Credit Union account.

05/12/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"Below is the synopsis that was sent to the FTC : This is an update, addition, clarification and correction to the previous submitted report. 

To begin with, I was in a stock market trading group called XXXX. XXXX is a stock market trading online instructional provider in XXXX. An individual named XXXX XXXX is/was the group leader and coordinator in XXXX. Her contact information XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ). The user ID is XXXX, channel ID is XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX this person contacted me to join in a come back community promotion for a day trading course. The individual ( hereby referred to as HER/SHE ) stated in order to join the class i would need to open an account in XXXX to use for study purposes, which I did so. I was instructed to to send the money to her partner XXXX XXXX XXXX CashApp, which I did through our personal checking account on XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00}, in total. 

During this transaction I was reluctant/suspicious, however, when CashApp verified the transaction I assumed it was legitimate due to the verification process CashApp has implemented. 

After logging back into my XXXX account I saw that she had transferred in total {$1000.00} into my XXXX which further gave me confidence in the legitimacy. 

At this point she told me that in order to start the day trading I needed to fund the account to {$5000.00}. I informed her that I did not have {$4000.00} to invest. At this point she said she would invest {$2000.00} of her own money if we could provide the other {$2000.00} to reach the total of {$5000.00}. Again the {$2000.00} 'appeared ' in the 'account ' further adding to our trust in the legitimacy. ( In hind site, we realize there was no 'account ', just coding. ) She told me that the trading class could not start until my account balance reached {$5000.00}. For the additional {$2000.00} from our side, we used a cash advance on a credit card for the balance. 

At this point, She told me to create an account in XXXX XXXX so I would be able to withdraw funds from XXXX as they came available. She 'sends {$1500.00} from CashApp XXXX XXXX XXXX. She contacted me to ask for confirmation of receipt of the {$1500.00} in XXXX XXXX. As soon as I confirm, the total {$1500.00} was withdrawn, I assume by her, and was therefore a XXXXXXXX XXXX 

At this point I go back to the XXXX site at the total funds in this 'account ' is {$9400.00}. This is a 'profit ' of {$4500.00} and a total amount deposited of {$4900.00}. I tried multiple times to withdraw differing amounts but every time the site 's message was "" sorry, the minimum amount you can withdraw is {$10000.00} ''. 

At this point it became abundantly apparent that all of this was a scam, further evidenced by her completely blocking me from all messaging apps. We contacted CashApp regarding this as we assumed that CashApp would vet its users. We filed a dispute with CashApp with request for a refund, case number XXXX, however, they ultimately denied the claim.

05/31/24,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"****FOLLOW-UP COMPLAINT TO XXXX *****NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT EITHER. PLEASE RESPOND AND DO NOT CLOSE***** Once again, it seems like you are ignoring the complaint. You claim that you have read everything in depth. That is clearly not the case when youre using language like my account, indicating that I created the account and it belongs to me. I AM NOT A PAYPAL USER IN ANY WAYS. I do not have any accounts on your platform, and I dont use any similar money transfer platform either. I never provided my bank information to your company as a result. Please stop using language like that because it clearly does not depict the nature of this stiation, meaning further lies and misinformation are being expressed here. I can not believe you are saying in XX/XX/XXXX that this account presents no signs of stolen identity. Were the documents I sent you of no indication? Meaning that police reports and even your own back end team confirmed I didnt make any of these transactions, as well as create the account? If everyone is telling you something, certified parties ( including your very own even ) are going to be someone to trust in this case. It seems that when conducting your review, you conveniently chose to ignore the documents I sent to you. Furthermore, the first source of contact I had with your executive office never shared any information clarifying the nature of contact I, as XXXX, had with you. You mention that I called to add my social security number. I would never do something like that, and it is illogical to think so when I dont use PayPal or any other money transfer service. The goal here is to remove the account, not interact with it, so it doesnt make sense as to how I would call to add my SSN. I cant believe this was even sent by you. Just confirms you have no idea what youre talking about and making responses to this without considering anything that is accurately depicting the facts and nature of this situation. As far as XXXX goes, I never opened claims with you. I dont understand any of your terminology your company has at PayPal because I am not a user. Meaning I would also not open a claims, especially when you say that they are blank with no transactions. I never received any such emails from you guys either. It has been confirmed that there was unauthorized activity and account creation on this platform. You claim the opposite but dont give valid proof as to why you think it is considered as authorized. In fact, you even admitted to the fact that there is inconsistent geographical addresses used to access the account, further supporting my argument. I know I got access to this account in my location, meaning that it would be different from where the thief created and made all these transactions from. The point for you indicating that I am to provide documentation to confirm everything is XXXX. I didnt get any emails, so wrong again. Moreover, why would I ever do that if the police reports that have been sent to you directly includes that as part of review? It doesnt make sense to ask for documentation when the last thing I want to do is use PayPal ; I want to close the account because I am not a user in any way as a result. Honestly, theres way too much information here to comment on that is untruthful, and frankly, unscrupulous in what youre doing. As well as illegal where its something you can get in trouble for in assuring consumer protection, customer or not, but the opposite happens. My bank does not supersede you in any regard when on their end the merchant at question is PayPal, another type of money service. Meaning all matters have to be dealt with you, and they said they cant do anything to help. Im not sure why credit unions are suggested because they dont deal with unauthorized activity. My credit thankfully hasnt been affected by any of this ( probably because I am XXXX ). Law enforcement is already included in this with working with my police department, so once again, you have not read any information and are taking matters without considering any relevant information.

It showed our payment going up by over {$1000.00} from what we were paying - from {$1900.00} to {$2900.00}. This is mostly due to a shortage and estimated amount on our property taxes - our homeowners insurance went up a bit as well but it is mainly the property taxes.

I called NewRez on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX in Customer Service. She said they did not have any documentation that we were tax exempt and I should email the paperwork to them.

Background : I am the homeowner of the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I finalized a refinance process through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which resulted in the final payment of {$520000.00} being made to XXXX, thereby fully settling the mortgage loan on my property. The lien was subsequently released to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the mortgage loan was transferred to XXXX, who is the current and sole lienholder. 

Issue and Impact on Me : Despite having provided evidence of loan settlement and the lien release, I have been subjected to a series of unprofessional and potentially misleading communications from the XXXX XXXX XXXX and Gregory Funding. Notably, there was an attempt to collect an additional debt of {$34000.00}, which was added to the loan post-settlement and without clear origin or justification. 
Recently this has led to a pending foreclosure case initiated by Gregory Funding, causing immense stress and uncertainty about the future of my home and financial stability.

2. Unprofessional Conduct : The handling of my case has been fraught with unprofessional interactions and a lack of attention to detail, as evidenced by the correspondence provided. 
XXXX. Incorrect Correspondence : I have received letters not intended for me, indicating a lack of proper record-keeping and communication protocols. 

Action Requested : I request that the CFPB conduct a thorough investigation into the actions of Gregory Funding and the XXXX XXXX XXXX.

05/29/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I had fallen behind on my mortgage payment due to a decrease in my monthly income. In order to prevent a foreclosure, I initially requested a loan modification with my lender, Carrington. However, due to the pandemic the loan fell back into default. Therefore, I decided to sell my property. I hired a real estate company and gave them 3rd party authorization to my mortgage account. They submitted an application for a short sale on my behalf in XXXX XXXX XXXX. Carrington contacted my representative indicating the offer for short sale had been denied, because websites like XXXX and XXXX indicated my home was worth nearly double the purchase contract offer. They also said my home was a 3-family. My real estate representative explained that my home was a 2-family. I provided the Certificate of Occupancy registered with the city. Carrington was also told that comparing my 2-family home with online resources of 3-family homes is inflating the value of my home. Additionally, it is not a legitimate way to evaluate the current condition of my home, which requires a physical inspection by an independent licensed professional. Afterwards, my real estate representative was contacted by individuals that purported themselves to be associated with Carrington and were asking questions regarding my loss mitigation application. They claimed to be from a company named XXXX XXXX. My real estate representative was concerned since this company was unknown to me as an entity associated with my mortgage loan. I thought they might have been fraudsters trying to gain access to my account information. However, Carrington stated XXXX XXXX is an authorized vendor and they had released my loss mitigation information to them without my knowledge. Carrington also stated, XXXX XXXX had the right to approve or deny any Short Sale offer and would make all final decisions. This was a surprise since I do not have a loan with them, had not authorized the release of my personal information to XXXX XXXX and was unclear regarding their role and why I would need their permission to evaluate my loss mitigation options. As time persisted XXXX XXXX only presented the option for a Deed in Lieu. They indicated a Deed in Lieu would give me compensation for relocating. Although I had never requested compensation for relocation, they used this offer to continually coerce me to accept a Deed in Lieu as my only choice for loss mitigation with Carrington. I rejected the Deed in Lieu option and asked to continue to be considered for all loss mitigation options, which XXXX XXXX refused to do. Additionally, XXXX XXXX asked to be allowed to come inside my property. I agreed as long as an independent non-affiliated professional came to evaluate my home. They refused to send a person other than someone from their own company to evaluate the value of my property. After some research, I discovered XXXX XXXX is actually a real estate company that employs agents who work for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I believe XXXX XXXX was acting on their own behalf to try and obtain my property so they could eventually sell it themselves. They had no desire to resolve my foreclosure or engage in my loss mitigation options. This creates a major conflict of interest since they are claiming to evaluate my personal loss mitigation options. XXXX XXXX  intentions are disingenuous to me as a homeowner.

It appears the only way to get this resolved will be for Planet to contact VA to make sure they have the information they need. It looks like the assumption agreement may not have been done correctly as it released the liability but did not transfer entitlement to the new owner but Im not completely sure. I dont seem to get anywhere when contacting Planet as they wont talk to me about the loan. My suggestion is to try and contact management at Planet to push them to contact VA to get it resolved.

Resolution notes : This file should be a XXXX not an assumption. This all falls back on planet home lending. They have not filed the correct assumption. They have yet to process the funding fee. I have reached out to them with no response.to this point. We as VA can not move forward until the funding fee has been processed.

This is the first I have heard that the assumption document was not correct, earlier they said they received information from Planet but now they are saying they have not. 
When they say XXXX that means Substitution of Entitlement, which means the person that assumed your loan replaces your VA entitlement attached to the property with theirs which frees yours up to be used again. It sounds like the assumption should have stated Assumption with Substitution of Entitlement instead of Assumption with Release of Liability.

05/18/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"XXXX ) I have been attempting to recast my loan for two months. 
Around XX/XX/XXXX, I called NewRez, the servicer my loan was sold to, and received inadequate information. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my mortgage broker, who reached out to their NewRez contact. My mortgage broker was able to provide me with this information on the recast : Newrez Recast Requirements The mortgage recast process allows a customer to make a lump sum payment on the unpaid principal balance to reduce the monthly mortgage payment. 

Below you can learn more on the recast process! 


Eligibility The following loan products are not eligible for a recast : Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) Loans Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Loans Government National Mortgage Association ( GNMA ) Loans Bond Loans Jumbo Loans Requirements The recast fee is {$250.00} and will be subject to state guidelines. 

The fee must be paid upfront. 

The required curtailment is {$5000.00}. 

The loan must be current. 

Recast may not commence within 60 days of origination.

Recast must be requested within 60 days of the principal reduction.

Recast requests are limited to one per 12 months.

Signed recast agreement by the customer.

Process 1. Contact Newrez Customer Service at XXXX to request the mortgage recast. 

XXXX. The loan will be reviewed for eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, a Recast letter outlining the process and a Recast authorization form are mailed to the customer. 

XXXX. A principal reduction payment of {$5000.00} or greater must be made. 

a. This can be made via bank wire, by check, or through Newrez 's website. Please see below for additional payment instructions. 

XXXX. The fee is {$250.00} and will be subject to state guidelines. The fee must be paid upfront. 

Once Newrez has received the signed Recast authorization form, the principal reduction payment, and the {$250.00} Recast fee payment, the new principal and interest payment will be finalized, and a confirmation letter will be sent to the customer. 

According to my mortgage broker 's NewRez contact, NewRez had my contact information, my mortgage information, my eligibility, and was going to issue me a letter per the process described above. I received this information on XX/XX/XXXX. I never received further contact from NewRez. 

On XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, I called NewRez again. Each of these phone calls take XXXX minutes due to hold time, navigating to get a live person, etc. 
On XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, the NewRez representative gave me inaccurate inforamation. 
They told me to just make a payment over the phone, and it would be taken care of. 
They did not check my eligibility, they did not provide anything that would lead me to believe the payment wouldn't just be counted against principal. So I did not make a payment, but asked them to issue me the recast letter per their written instructions that had been provided to my mortgage broker. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, I am two months in, and have no information from NewRez to move forward on recasting my loan. 

XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from NewRez indicating a dramatic increase in escrow payments due to homeowner insurance rate increases. I called my insurance broker, and then attempted to call NewRez on several occassions because the information they sent to me didn't make sense : They were suggesting I make an annual payment spaced out over 48 months. That doesn't make sense to me, because insurance payments are annual, next year there will be another high annual payment. 
When I called, the NewRez rep on the phone could not answer my questions. 
I reached out over email. I conveyed this request for information to NewRez on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I reached out again via email on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

In the letter it shows Bank of America is going to defer property taxes paid. The amount of property taxes paid is included in the total amount to be deferred. 

I reported to Bank of America on XX/XX/2024 that I had paid the taxes and any amount Bank of America paid was an overpayment. 

Per the tax office on XX/XX/2024 they refunded the overpayment of property taxes to Bank of America. 

XXXX XXXX states that she can see that Bank of America received the refund check for the taxes. 

According to XXXX XXXX I can go ahead and sign the letter with the total including taxes refunded to Bank of America. This would mean Bank if America would be paid twice for the taxes.

She further states that if I sign the letter, I should trust Bank of America will fix it on the back end. This is dishonest and not fair to the customer. Asking a customer to sign an incorrect document seems illegal. 

I did everything right. On XX/XX/2024 XXXX BOfA notified a refund was being mailed. ( see attached ). The XX/XX/2024 notice was weeks before the XX/XX/2024 letter went out. 

Bank of America should have verified Everything prior to sending out that XX/XX/2024 letter. 

The other option to correct Bank of America mistake would be to have Bank of America will need to verify the monies were refunded with escrow and this would void the current payment deferral letter. 

And a new evaluation would need to take place prior to a new deferral payment letter being sent out. 

The process can take up to 30 days and in this reevaluation. This would be XX/XX/2024.

Below are the details of my situation : Successor of Interest : I have been appointed as the successor of interest following the passing of the original borrower.

Issue with Payoff Balance : I have been attempting to secure the accurate payoff balance for this account. However, the balance has inexplicably increased by approximately {$5000.00} without any itemized explanation.

Investigation Efforts : I have reviewed county records which suggest that the additional fees charged are related to an order of sale. Despite this, I have been unable to obtain clear information or justification for these charges.

Lack of Communication : I have contacted Fifth Third Bank 's mortgage servicing department multiple times, but they have been unable to provide answers regarding the fee increases.

Attorney Unresponsiveness : I was advised to reach out to Fifth Third Banks attorney, XXXX, XXXX, and Associates, who has not responded to any of my electronic or verbal requests for information. 

Duration : This issue has been ongoing for over a year. 

Title Company Involvement : The title company I am working with has also faced difficulties in obtaining the correct payoff balance, as Fifth Third Bank has refused to respond to the title company request. I then have to call to follow up on why the are not releasing the information. 

Escalation Attempts : I sent a fax to the Office of the President of Fifth Third Bank and was assured the matter would be looked into. However, I have yet to receive a satisfactory resolution. Furthermore, Fifth Third Bank will not accept any payment exceeding the original payment amount, resulting in returned payments in the deceased borrowers name making it extremely difficult to payoff the debt prior to me deciding find a new service provider. 

As a result of these ongoing issues, I have been unable to close out the balance under the deceased borrowers name and switch the account to my preferred servicer. This situation has caused significant stress and inconvenience. These issues arose after the hardship application was submitted and approved. It was brought to my attention that the hardship approval was reversed because the agent who called to get a verbal acceptance did not properly record it in the system.

In the meantime, they reported our delinquent payments to the credit agencies and, they still fail to understand that they aren't even supposed to buy forced placed insurance, because we have an escrow account. If for some reason, there isn't enough money to cover the premium, they are supposed to cover it and bill us for the deficiency. Unless our insurance was cancelled for something other than non payment, they can't do that. They still fail to realize it. 

In the meantime, due to extra payments going to them, our credit is back in the XXXX. It was horrible from about XXXX, due to the untimely death of our XXXX XXXX XXXX daughter in a XXXX XXXX  that took a toll on us, the judicial portion took forever and we just didn't care. We never thought wed be able to buy a home again and now that we have, we are regretting it due, in large part, to the servicing. 

We have come to the conclusion that they send us convoluted information on purpose so that we don't understand where our money is going. They give us advice and then all of a sudden we are in a loan modification situation. Our trust has gone out the window. We have owned several other homes and have never had this issue with a servicer. 

They charged us {$200.00} for an attorney fee. When I asked what that was for, back in XXXX, they told us it was "" in case you want to do a loan modification. "" We were also told at that time that we didn't qualify for a loan modification. 

We have also been continually charged {$20.00} per month, evidently for some guy to come by to make sure we live here. Really? Where else would we live? Junk fee? 

Also, the statements show all money going in and out of escrow in ways we do not understand. What in the world is "" walk in cash ''? I know we aren't walking it in and if someone else is... who is it and why? 

They sent us an annual escrow accounting with anticipated, actual and difference and it made zero sense. Nothing added up correctly. Its like they have someone who knows nothing about mortgages or accounting and just willy nilly plugging in numbers. And why is all money running through escrow? That is for insurance and taxes only -- there should be separate accounts for held payments ( if it is a partial payment or whatever ) Our dog could do a more clear accounting of our mortgage.

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  claims to have sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to have hired XXXX XXXX XXXX ( dba XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to service the loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX then involved McCalla Raymer Leibert Pierce LLC in their attempt to foreclose the property. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the complainant endured undue influence from the Notary Public during the closing procedures when she prevented the complainant from restricting her indorsement on the mortgage chattels. The complainant, being the true owner and holder of the chattels including the promissory note, never intended to gift the note or any of the chattels to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or McCalla Raymer Leibert Pierce LLC and only intended for them to hold the chattels on special deposit. She intended to deposit the promissory note into her own account, and never authorized the defendants to deposit the note into their account. The promissory note was the property that the complainant intended to pledge as collateral for the mortgage, not her real estate property. The complainant only granted the alleged owner and servicer a security interest in the promissory note in exchange for valuable consideration, which has still not been given to the complainant as of the filing of this complaint. The complainant never intended to grant legal title in any of her property to any of the parties previously mentioned, including McCalla Raymer Leibert Pierce LLC. The Purchase Money Security Deed was solely intended to secure the complainants repayment of the mortgage, which she tendered on XX/XX/XXXX. Section 27 of the Security Deed titled Release clearly states that : Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender will cancel this Security Instrument. The complainant has asked all involved opposing parties to provide a full accounting for her account multiple times via written request, the initial request sent via United States Postal Service Certified Mail on XX/XX/XXXX, and every time they have either refused the request or only provided partial accounting. On XX/XX/XXXX, all involved opposing parties were served a Deed of Dissolution of Trust discharging them of their Trustee capacity via United States Postal Service Registered Mail to dissolve the trust that was created by the complainant when she indorsed the Security Deed. The complainant also served a Revocation of Power of Attorney and Security Interest to all involved opposing parties on XX/XX/XXXX, which stripped them of their Power of Attorney and agent-in fact authorities and removed their right to a Power of Sale of the real property of subject. The complainant tendered three ( 3 ) special deposits with Notice of Equitable Redemption via United States Postal Service Registered Mail to settle her account, first to the Chief Financial Officer of XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and twice to the Indenture Trustee of XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. on XX/XX/XXXX. These three special deposits along with the promissory note deposited on XX/XX/XXXX, prove that the complainant has tendered XXXX ( XXXX ) different payments to the defendants to settle the alleged debt. The complainant obtained a Forensic Mortgage Securitization Audit which provided XXXX XXXX data proving that not only was her mortgage account already settled and repaid to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but that they have also converted and securitized the complainants mortgage chattels and are currently trading them on stock exchange markets and retaining all the profits. The records of accounting provided by the defendants in no way match the Forensic Mortgage Securitization Audit data. The complainant received a copy of the promissory note with the allonge from McCalla Raymer Leibert Pierce LLC on XX/XX/XXXX, and the note does not contain a special indorsement signifying the assignment of the mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As of the filing of this complaint, neither McCalla Raymer Leibert Pierce LLC or any other party previously mentioned in this complaint has provided the complainant with a copy of the promissory note that identifies them as title holders with any valid claim, right or interest in the promissory note or the real property of subject.

All involved opposing parties materially altered the complainants mortgage chattels by applying their own indorsements without her consent. 3. All involved opposing parties converted the mortgage chattels for their own use without the consent of the complainant. 4.

Refusal to provide a full accounting for the complainant 's account to show what disposition they have made of the trust funds, money, and other property in their possession. E. Clogging the complainants right to redeem the mortgage on several different occasions. 5. All involved opposing parties retain wrongful possession of the land, rights, titles, interests, and property after receiving full payment from the complainant to settle the account. 6. All involved opposing parties are violating the complainants order revoking their security interest and Power of Attorney/Power of Sale privileges . 7. All involved opposing parties have not proven their authority to foreclose on the complainants property by way of Power of Attorney granted by either the alleged owner or servicer of the mortgage, which displays they also do not have any de jure authority to foreclose on the complainants property. 8.

At that time, my single-point of contact person, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I do a formal repayment plan to help me regain my footing, having advised me of additional options for repayment not available through informal means, up to and including deferral of missed payments at the end of the loan. 

Through a very rigorous process, fraught with delays, I provided all documents requested of me in Fay 's request for documents including hardship letters, monthly household expenses, profit and loss statements for XXXX ( given the option of providing these in lieu of tax returns which are still being prepared ). On several occasions, I called my single-point-of contact person, XXXX XXXX, to obtain account updates or clarification of requests for supplemental information, without response to telephonic and email contacts. I was advised of having missing information, even though email transmissions were sent with all documents attached. I would then be asked to provide some different form of the same information already provided. I provided detailed profit and loss statements via XXXX that interfaces with my XXXX banking institutions, for business and personal use ; these were reportedly too confusing ; XXXX XXXX indicated the preference would have been for handwritten information which can not be verified, whereas XXXX provides detailed transactions that coincide with bank accounts. Each time I submitted the information requested, there would be yet another hoop to jump through. 

XXXX XXXX uncharacteristically began ignoring my calls and emails ; in fact he had a history of emailing me to discuss my account. Suddenly, this was no longer an option for communication. This seemed to be a means to prolong the process of establishing a repayment plan and become further delinquent.

05/13/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I have had issues with poor and inadequate communication from U.S. Bank Home Mortgage ever since my chosen lender sold the mortgage. 

In approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I did not receive a monthly statement. I called the bank to ask for the payment amount, which I paid at a branch. The following month, my statement did not reflect that the payment had been made, but did not explain why. I later learned that the bank had given me the incorrect payment amount, and their policy is that in this event, the payment is "" held in suspense '' and nothing is credited until the full payment has been made. However, the bank never explained this in writing ; the only way I found out was with the help of a U.S. Bank branch manager who called U.S. Bank Home Mortgage on my behalf. 

I later called the mortgage company to ask how much the shortage was, so I could pay it and be restored. Customer service told me that would resolve things, so I made the payment. However, it was still not credited. When I called to ask for explanation, the representative told me I had been misinformed by the prior rep, and "" that's not how it works '' - but with no explanation or instructions on how to resolve it. 

U.S. Bank also revoked my online access to my own mortgage account, without notice or explanation. I assumed it was a login error, but when I called to correct it, they told me that they'd revoked my access, but would reinstate it once my bankruptcy was over. This made it more difficult for me to make monthly payments, particularly during the pandemic- and they've never given me any explanation as to why they did this. 

In XXXX the bankruptcy was over, so I called to request reinstatement of online access. U.S. Bank Home Mortgage told me they would still not reinstate my access, but declined to explain why, referring me to my bankruptcy attorney. I asked about hundreds of dollars in supposed fees which I've never received notice of, but which the phone automated system says I owe. I was promised written documentation by XX/XX/XXXX, but have never received anything. 

I made my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment on XX/XX/XXXX, through the U.S. Bank Home Mortgage online system, in the amount reflected on my XX/XX/XXXX statement, by requesting to pay "" the monthly amount. '' I received a receipt dated that date ; however, the XX/XX/XXXX statement reflects that, while the monthly amount was received, it was again "" held in suspense '', not applied to the mortgage as per my request- but with no explanation. 

I have since received threatening emails from U.S. Bank Home Mortgage, threatening adverse impact if I do not make the payment I already made. I twice tried to reply, but the address would not accept incoming messages. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a certified letter to U.S. Bank Home Mortgage, requesting 1 ) that they apply my XXXX mortgage payment to the account ; 2 ) reinstatement of online account access ; and 3 ) detailed written documentation of any supposed fees I owe, none of which I have ever received notice of, including amounts, dates, and what they are for. US. Bank signed for the letter on XX/XX/XXXX, but they have not responded. 

This has been the worst experience I have ever had with any company, by far. Multiple times I've asked U.S. Bank Home Mortgage customer service what to do to resolve their errors, and have followed their instructions, only to be told that my efforts were unsuccessful, but never with any explanation. 

Thank you for listening, and I appreciate any help you can provide. 

I will attach the letter I sent the bank in XXXX, and will happily provide the bank 's own documentation as needed, to support that my mortgage statements do not reflect any fees, that they have received my monthly mortgage payments in the exact amount they said I owe, and that they have failed to apply my XXXX and likely now my XXXX mortgage payments, without explanation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,NE,68111,,Consent provided,Web,05/13/24,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,8997917,"The consumer complaint is against U.S. Bank Home Mortgage for poor communication and errors in mortgage account management.

Section XXXX of the loan contract states that. The Note Holder will deliver or mail to me a notice of any changes in my initial fixed interest rate to an adjustable interest rate and of any changes in my adjustable interest rate before the effective date of any change. 

Based on Sections XXXX of the loan note I was expecting an email or letter prior to the initial ARM term completion to indicate the amount of the new monthly payment. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that looks like XXXX is getting ready to adjust. Please feel free to call or email with any questions. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I responded thanking XXXX XXXX for reaching out and asking if he can please let me know the interest rate and monthly payment once the initial loan period expires. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I had a phone meeting with XXXX XXXX. No specifics were communicated regarding the new interest rate and monthly payment once the initial loan period expires. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating. I was able to do a little research. I am estimating that your rate will adjust to XXXX or XXXX. The index it is tied to has been moving quite a bit though. He also provided some refinance options. 

XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX. I emailed XXXX XXXX to request exact details about the new interest rate and monthly payment once the initial loan period expires. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email from XXXX giving me several options for refinancing and adjusting the loan and attaching some example documents. Apparently, he seemed to think I was requesting information on a refinance loan. He did not respond to my original request for the new interest rate and monthly payment once the current loan period expires. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted the First Tech Federal Bay Area Mortgage Manager, XXXX XXXX to request specifics on the new interest rate and monthly payment once the initial loan period expires. XXXX XXXX said she did not have information regarding existing loans but will put me in touch with someone at First Tech who does. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that Good afternoon, we received an inquiry regarding the rate change on your mortgage account ending in XXXX. After review, your rate will not change until XX/XX/XXXX. You will receive a 90-day notice of the change. Please let us know if you have any further questions. My complete and full interpretation of his email was that the current interest rate and monthly payment would not change until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a letter was mailed to my home address via USPS and an email sent to my email account requesting an updated home insurance policy. I responded providing my updated home insurance coverage policy. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email from First Tech stating that that an additional {$1100.00} is due for the XX/XX/XXXX payment in addition to the payment of {$2100.00} that was received on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire why there was an additional amount due for the XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I received a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that buried in the statements section of the First Tech online portal is a letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX, indicating a rate increase but not addressing his email of XX/XX/XXXX indicating that the next rate change will take effect on XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a certified letter to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX noting the correspondence taken place since XX/XX/XXXX, and requesting he review the issues. No response to my letter has been received to date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from I with XXXX XXXX XXXX, requesting I call her. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX XXXX who said she can not do anything to rectify the situation noted in my letter to XXXX XXXX. 

If you wish to have a copy of all emails and letters referenced in this letter, please let me know and I will email or mail the copies to your office. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was forced into a very unfortunate situation in having to find an additional {$1100.00} to be able to pay the XXXX mortgage payment and to do this every month thereafter because XXXX XXXX XXXX could not take the time to notify of me the new monthly payment appropriately. 

Why on XX/XX/XXXX did a representative from XXXX XXXX email me to indicate that my monthly mortgage payment would not adjust until XX/XX/XXXX. Why was XXXX XXXX not able to mail out a letter or send an email 30 days prior to the effective date of the new monthly payment. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX can mail and email a letter when it concerns protecting its loan but when it concerns an increase in interest expense of XXXX per month, they were unable to do the same. 

The loan document and certified letter sent to the XXXX of First Tech Federal Credit Union are included with this complaint filing. 

Please let me know if you require copies of the emails referenced above and any additional information you require.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,First Technology Federal Credit Union,CA,94303,,Consent provided,Web,05/12/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8985823,"The consumer filed a complaint against First Tech Federal Credit Union for inadequate communication regarding a change in their Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) interest rate.

05/09/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I requested an appraisal on my home through mortgage company as part of the process to remove PMI. I contacted the lender ( PennyMac Mortgage ) on XX/XX/XXXX and they advised I must receive an appraisal from their approved appraisal company to remove company to remove PMI. The agent advised there was a fee for the appraisal of {$250.00} I believe. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and completed the process to begin the appraisal, agreed to pay the appraisal fee answered the question from the lender and one of the questions was have I done in significant updates on the home, which I had. I had a completely unfinished XXXX sq. ft. basement that I turned in XXXX bedroom, XXXX bathroom, full kitchen, living room, dining room, and separate HVAC system. In addition, I added a tankless water heater, had a concrete path added to the backyard, added a steel fence, and screened-in XXXX outdoor areas. This all came to about XXXX worth of updates. The lender advised that I qualified for the appraisal and scheduled an appraiser ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to come out XX/XX/XXXX. I received the completed appraisal from PennyMac in late XXXX. However, I had concerns. The appraisal which was completed on XX/XX/XXXX came in at {$610000.00} which I thought was odd because when I purchased the home XX/XX/XXXX and the appraisal price was {$610000.00}. Although, I had done around XXXX worth of work and added over XXXX sq ft of finished space to my home, the new appraisal I received was only {$2000.00} more than the appraisal when I purchased the home. I contacted PennyMac and advised them of concerns on XX/XX/XXXX. They advised me to submit a dispute by showing comparable homes in the area. I sent them the dispute via their "" Messaging Center '', those messages have since been deleted from my view on the website. The agent that communicated with said they had received the documents and after much back and forth and escalation agreed to raise my appraisal value to around {$640000.00}. Which is still disputed and asked for an updated appraisal report with the changed value. I never received an updated appraisal report, nor did they follow up on my further dispute and told me that they could not send out another appraisal company and I couldnt use my own. The original message that I sent though the PennyMac Secure Messaging on XX/XX/XXXX is below and attached in the documents under Appraisal Comparison XXXX document. What prompted my complaint now after giving up due to the frustration of dealing with PennyMac is that I received my annual tax assessment for my home from the county for XXXX and the Fair Market Value of my home according to the tax assessors office as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$680000.00}. 

***Original Message to PennyMac via Message Center on XX/XX/XXXX : Hello, I requested PMI deletion on my loan. I paid the fee and the appraiser came out. I reviewed the appraisal report and I'm disputing the appraised value on the report. I spoke with a representative from PMI Deletion Dept. today who advised that I should send 3-5 comparable homes over to have them reviewed to dispute the appraisal. I have an attached an XXXX file which shows the 5 comparables and how they compare to the appraisal I received from your appraiser. 
As noted in the attached spreadsheet the subject home ( my home ) was not valued fairly compared to the comparable homes. Although the subject home is bigger and has more bedrooms and bathrooms than the comparables the price per sq. ft. and suggested sale price by your appraiser is significantly lower than the comparables. 
The subject home was originally XXXX with XXXX bedroom and XXXX bath. Summary of improvements done in home : Basement Finished in XXXX for additional XXXX of finished space for a total of XXXX sq. ft. The basement is a fully functional separate unit with private entrance, separate HVAC, XXXX beds, XXXX baths, full kitchen, living room and dining room. My home was originally valued at $ XXXX. XXXX when it sold but with the appraisal done by your appraiser it is now valued at $ XXXX. XXXX which a decrease of about $ XXXX. XXXX even though I completed major renovations and added over XXXX sq ft of living space to the home. In addition to the basement renovation, the water heater was switched to tankless water heater for the whole. A concrete path was built to go from the front of the home to the back, the patio and deck were screened in, and the backyard was fenced in. 
On your appraisers ' appraisal report it is noted that XXXX of work was completed on the home but none of that is factored into the value. The appraiser gave no credit for the extensive renovations completed and valued my house nearly the same as the XXXX appraisal when it was purchased in XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX XXXX reps consistently told me they will send wiring instructions a few days before I close. They never did. As I was signing my closing documents on XX/XX/2024, a Saturday, I notice the solar panel cost was included. I pointed this out to the notary. I mentioned it again to the builder and lender reps on XX/XX/2024 before I picked up my keys. 

Later that week, I explained the situation to XXXX XXXX of Clear Mortgage Capital. He told me he would amend the loan and send wiring instructions so I can purchase the solar panels and not have them included in my mortgage. Then he told me, XXXX can not take the solar panels out, it's included in the purchase price. All solar panels for new construction in CA must be included in the purchase price. 

I asked him, what California law states the cost of solar panels for new construction must be included in the purchase price of the home? He did not provide the California law.

However in XX/XX/XXXX, I found in my credit report showing the 30 day late payment from Caliber. This is confusing, since XXXX is reporting theyve been servicing my loan since XX/XX/XXXX and thats the same month Caliber is saying my payment were late. It seems like Caliber should not have had my mortgage that month, which makes me wonder if this was a mistake.

05/13/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Select Portfolio Services , Inc. grossly mishandled management of our mortgage account and escrow funds. On XX/XX/year>, we contacted Select Portfolio Services to address a significant issue concerning the mismanagement of our impounded taxes on our residential property. Despite repeated attempts to rectify the situation, we have encountered negligence and incompetence on the part of Select Portfolio Services , Inc., which has resulted in unpaid property taxes. 

The crux of the issue stems from Select Portfolio Services ' failure to properly update our impounded taxes to reflect the assessed taxes on our residential property. They have been paying our property taxes based on the pre-sale classification of our property as a vacant lot rather than basing it on the closing documentation provided to them as a residential property. This erroneous assessment persisted for XXXX months until an internal audit prompted a sudden reduction in the monthly amount due. However, despite biannual escrow analyses, Select Portfolio Services failed to correct the tax discrepancy, leading to an outstanding tax liability of {$36000.00}. 

Upon contacting Select Portfolio Services , Inc., by phone and subsequently via email on XX/XX/year>, we were assured by a representative that the matter would be promptly addressed and remedied. Specifically, we were informed that our escrow account would be credited {$40000.00}, the outstanding taxes would be paid, and the property tax records would be updated accordingly. However, no such action was taken. Furthermore, subsequent escrow analyses continued to reflect the incorrect property tax amount, exacerbating the situation. 

Despite multiple conversations with representatives, supervisors, and managers, it was only after an extended period of over an hour and a half that we were able to speak to a manager named "" XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' While she acknowledged the errors and expressed a willingness to rectify the situation, no remedy has been achieved to date. Instead, we were requested to provide Select Portfolio Services with additional time to communicate with their escrow department and oversee the necessary actions. However, there has been no communication or progress since this assurance. 

As a result of Select Portfolio Services ' negligence and incompetence, we have unpaid property taxes, uncredited funds to our escrow account and a loss of confidence in their ability to manage our mortgage account competently. Therefore, we are requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene and investigate this matter promptly. Specifically, we request that Select Portfolio Services, IncXXXX be compelled to : 1. Credit our escrow account with the {$45000.00} in Property taxes collected to date. 
2. Pay the outstanding property taxes amounting to {$36000.00}.

3. Ensure that our account is properly updated to reflect the accurate amount of property taxes moving forward.

We also request that Select Portfolio Services, Inc. be held accountable for their negligence and incompetence and implement measures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

We look forward to a prompt resolution and your assistance in rectifying this egregious situation.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",CA,90043,,Consent provided,Web,05/13/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8994751,"The consumer's mortgage account and escrow funds were grossly mishandled by Select Portfolio Services, resulting in unpaid property taxes.

05/08/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","In XXXX XXXX XXXX, I began the process to apply for a loan modification with PHH mortgage servicing. In order to be eligible for modification, I was required to make 6 loan payments of the total loan amount. In XXXX, I received the modification agreement to be notarized. I submitted that agreement but it was denied due to an error made by the notary. I resubmitted in XXXX ; however, the notary made another error so PHH sent one of their contracted notary servicers. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the notary came to my home and completed the process. My relationship manager, contacted me by email and stated the modification documents were received, approved, and the only thing remaining was the final payment amount. For two weeks I called the relationship manager since the payment could only be made by phone ( or mail - I do not like mailing checks or money orders ). In XXXX, I attempted to contact him again, was unable to reach him. He emailed me and I responded that I was waiting to be connected by phone to make the payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX he contacted me by phone to take the payment. At this time, he informed me that my loan was being sold and I would have a new servicer. I asked would the approval and modification be completed in time. He assured me multiple times that he would, and said he was confirming the approval as we were on the phone. He stated that there was nothing more to do, but began making my mortgage payments in XXXX. He did state that the payment would be due XX/XX/XXXX, but I would have to wait on documents from the new servicers, which would take about 2 weeks. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I received information from the new servicer. When I read the paperwork, I realized that the modification was not transferred to the new servicer because several things were wrong. The modification default amount was nearly {$10000.00} more than what it should have been, and the default was transferred rather than the modified agreement. I called the company immediately. They stated that PHH sent nothing, but they would request the updates. I also contacted PHH to try to reach the relationship manager, but I could only get his voicemail. I spoke to someone else, but they were not able to assist either because they said my loan could no longer be accessed. I was so stressed and worried. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, she was healthy. So as soon as I was released from the hospital, I began trying to contact the relationship manager again. I spoke to many representatives at PHH, some did not know what to do while others were very rude and refused my help. After nearly a month of trying to reach the relationship manager and ombudsman, he finally called me back. The ombudsman department on the other hand, never contacted me - although they sent several emails stating they tried to call me and could not reach me. I questioned them on this, and asked them by email to leave a voicemail the next time they called as proof of missed phone call since my call log was not recording their calls. They never did this either. 

In speaking with the relationship manager, he was very rude and extremely dismissive. He stated that the loan had been transferred, he could not longer access it and there was nothing that he could do. When I asked about the inflated interest amount, he laughed and mocked me stating that I knew nothing about finance and how the mortgage interests rates work. He refused to help me in anyway ; even when I asked if he could simply provide the documents as proof. 

I felt overwhelmed and defeated, so I reached out to the new service agents at XXXX mortgage servicer to see what they could do. They asked me to try their modification process so I began that at the end of XXXX. I sent all of the documents they requested over the next 12 weeks. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a denial letter. They gave me the options of short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure. I called them to ask for more assistance, and they stated they could not help me because I had a variable interest rate. This was quite shocking to me because I have never had a variable interest rate, only a fixed. So, they stated, they received documentation from PHH that I had a variable interest rate and there was nothing they could do to change it. Unlike times before, this agent was helpful and did allow me to provide her proof of the modification and fixed interest rate. However, she stated unless they sent it there would be nothing they could to honor it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I luckily was able to find the notary who signed the documents for me. She provided the mailing confirmation of the mod agreement. So, I contacted a rep at PHH. She was friendly and helpful. I asked her could she look for the signed notary agreement in my file and she found it! I was relieved, but also saddened that this information had been there all along. She said the modification was received by mail and uploaded in the system on XX/XX/XXXX. 

To date, I am still in limbo with my loan because both companies are refusing to acknowledge the modification agreement that was supposed to be in place. It was only never confirmed because my relationship for the manager did not submit and complete my file when we spoke on XX/XX/XXXX. Now the mistake of one person and their refusal to try to correct their error has my family at risk of losing our home.

05/26/24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Its come to my attention I was passed over in the Wells Fargo Mortgage denials remuneration program. Ive never received any info and I really should have. The fact I didnt allow my house to be stolen from me so they could steal my equity doesnt negate the fact they ultimately forced me out of my handicapped-accessible home and caused me massive hardships by denying loan modifications twice. 

I was unfairly denied the mortgagemodification offered to me by Wells Fargo in XXXX, and I was unfairly denied XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX program in XXXX, causing me to give up the home that was suited to my XXXX andinto a much harder situation. 

Wells Fargo forced me to continue to pay a higher mortgage rather than helping me do better, as was offered to me. The government paid forth for mortgage companies like Wells Fargo to help people like me. Wells Fargo decided that I wasnt worthy of paying {$600.00} per month, so they forced me to continue to pay {$1000.00} per month, and by effect, forced me out of the home I could have stayed in had I been helped as was offered to me. 

Despite a credit score of XXXX, flawlessly never missing a payment to WF or any creditor my entire life and to date, I was denied. Despite the fact I kept paying even in hardship, I was denied- twice. I had already spent XXXX  years showing I had been responsible with my mortgage despite fluctuating income - I just needed a modification to help for the time being, and it was being offered to me! The mortgage still would have been paid in full in the end. In fact, it probably would have been paid off to date - I should be mortgage-free now. 

It came to my attention that those with equity were targeted for denial because Wells Fargo would rather squeeze the homeowner out and take back the house to cash in on the equity by reselling the house to someone else. At the time I had around $ XXXX in equity. 

The modification would have afforded me the ability to stay in my modified home for the past XXXX years, as well as continue to grow my equity. Wells Fargo set me up to fail when they could have helped me. The repercussions were steep and continue to be so. I experienced further losses and hardship in moving, in living in a non-modified home, and they robbed me of what would have been my continued equity in the process, as well as a life in a far better neighborhood. 

As a single, XXXX mom Wells Fargo effectively forcedme out of my home and disrupted everything mydaughter everknew. It forced me into a house that, to thisday, I can not reach theone bathroom within due to my XXXX. If you'd like to know what that entails, you better be prepared for that answer. 

It also forced my daughter to change schools andlose her friends for her XXXX year. To add insult to injury, it leftme living in a drug and gunfire-filled neighborhood. Thankyou. We could have stayed in our good home with the modification and my daughter could have graduated with her class and I would be living in a safe, accessible home right now. Wells Fargo deeply affected my life and my daughter 's life.My life matters. My daughters life matters. Today that house is worth approximately {$350000.00}, representing a lost equity value to me of {$160000.00}. I could have stayed and paid the mortgage off over time with a modification and been holding that equity. 

As a result, I'm asking for {$160000.00} in the lost equity I would have gained had mortgage modification been allowed as offered. Im not looking to punish Wells Fargo further despite it being warranted. I want my lost equity, and I want to cap it at this time and place. 

I was a good customer. Wells Fargo took advantage and hurt me on multiple counts. I have never recovered financially or physically from having to rehome myself to a lesser-quality home, and my daughter has never forgiven me for ruining her XXXX year.In fact, she doesnt speak to me anymore. As she is my only remaining family member I can not begin to tell you the sadness I live with every day, how much I love and miss her, and my family, and now in a house that causes me pain and barriers every day as well. Have I suffered enough? 

My relief ask is {$160.00}, XXXX in my mortgage case. This will allow me to make the necessary changes to move on with my life as much as possible. Both denials were under my former last name. 

FYI I also experienced Wells Fargos embezzlement fraud, and somehow they seem to think that {$180.00} covers all that. It doesnt. I would have been in jail for felony embezzlement for a long time and paid stiff fines had I stolen from Wells Fargo.

During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to inquire about our options since we had fallen XXXX months behind on payments. During the call, I was informed that I could either spread the missed payments over the next XXXX months or add them to the back half of the loan, and possibly even add a third missed payment, to the latter portion of the loan. The representative mentioned that a packet containing further details would be sent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again to inquire about the status of the packet. The lady I spoke with informed me that I had been approved for a loan XXXX, which involved adding XXXX months of missed payments to the end of the mortgage. However, due to the outstanding balance exceeding XXXX XXXX of the principal, which was around {$450000.00}, adding a third missed payment would result in an increase in the interest rate from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX for the duration of the loan. 

My concern arises from the discrepancy between what the first representative mentionedadding XXXX or XXXX paymentsand the terms presented during the second call. If we were to add XXXX payments to the end of the loan, we would remain at the XXXX XXXX interest rate with a monthly payment of {$3200.00}. However, according to Freedom 's calculations, opting for the XXXX loan XXXX would escalate the interest rate to XXXX XXXX, resulting in a {$1000.00} increase in monthly payments. 

Furthermore, I sought clarification on the current amount added to the outstanding balance within the XXXX XXXX threshold. Despite previously undergoing a loan modification during the XXXX pandemic, a monthly payment of {$3200.00} for XXXX months totals {$76000.00}, suggesting that there should still be sufficient room within the XXXX XXXX limit.

We contacted Fay Servicing and were provided the option to pay the bill online. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, on the Fay website, we selected to make a payment to escrow to cover our property taxes bill which Fay paid. On the Fay servicing website, we selected the option to apply the payment of {$7000.00} to our escrow account in order to repay the tax bill.

The loan had an XXXX "" With Pay Deferred Interest '' ( WPDI ) promotion, which allowed for deferred interest if payments were made timely. 

Promotional Terms : Promotion Duration : 18 months, ending XX/XX/XXXX. 
Grace Period : Payments could not be more than 30 days late, or the promotional offer would terminate early. 
Events Leading to the Complaint : XXXX XXXX : In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX payment was made 36 days late, exceeding the XXXX grace period, allegedly causing the promotion to terminate. 
Lack of Notification : Despite the promotional offer being terminated, the subsequent billing statements from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX continued to reflect a "" Promotional Expiry Date '' of XX/XX/XXXX, and showed the deferred interest charges as {$0.00}. 
The loan overview document from XX/XX/XXXX also showed a promotion expiry date of XX/XX/XXXX, and deferred interest not included in the total balance. 
XXXX of Accrued Interest : In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX to get a loan payoff amount, but there was no mention of my promotional period having been terminated. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX again for a loan payoff amount, only to learn that the deferred interest promotion had ended over a year ago due to the late payment, and all deferred interest charges were now being included in the payoff balance. 
Had I been notified of the termination of the promotional offer at the time of the late payment, I would have paid off the loan to avoid accruing interest at 17.99 %. 
Impact of Lack of Notification : The lack of notification resulted in a significant increase in my loan balance due to the retroactive interest charges. 
The billing statements misled me into believing that the promotional offer was still active. 
Resolution Requested : Reinstatement of Promotion : Re-instate the deferred interest promotion and waive the accrued interest charges. 
Correction of Statements : Adjust my account to reflect accurate statements based on the original promotion. 
Supporting Documentation : Loan Overview Document ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : Shows a promotion expiry date of XX/XX/XXXX, despite the promotion being voided. 

Billing Statements ( XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX ) : Each statement reflects a promotion expiry date of XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX deferred interest charges.

On XX/XX/2023, I applied for credit with InstaLoan. I received a notice of action taken, indicating that my application was denied due to the company 's inability to confirm that I am not a XXXX covered borrower. The stated reasons were either a system outage, an issue with the application, or a credit freeze. 

I believe this denial is unwarranted and constitutes a violation of my rights for the following reasons : 1. **Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Violation** : The ECOA prohibits discrimination against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because an applicant receives income from a public assistance program. The inability to confirm my status as a XXXX XXXX  borrower should not be grounds for credit denial if it was due to a system error or technical issue on the part of the creditor. This denial may indicate discriminatory practices or negligence in processing my application. 

2. **Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Violation** : The FCRA requires that credit reporting agencies ensure the accuracy and privacy of information included in consumer reports. If the denial was based on a credit freeze or inaccurate information, InstaLoan may have failed to uphold the accuracy and privacy standards mandated by the FCRA.

I request that the CFPB investigate this matter to ensure that InstaLoan complies with the XXXX and FCRA and that my consumer rights are protected. Please find attached the notice of action taken and any other relevant documents supporting my complaint.

In relation to the accounts listed incorrectly based on the following Department of Treasury Publication 4681 : Cancelled Debts, Foreclosures, Repossessions and Abandonments Forms 1099-A and 1099-C. A lender who ac-quires an interest in your property in a foreclosure or repossession should send you Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Se-cured Property, showing information you need to figure your gain or loss. However, if the lender also cancels part of your debt and must file Form 1099-C, the lender can include the information about the foreclosure or repossession on that form instead of on Form 1099-A. The lender must file Form 1099-C and send you a copy if the amount of debt canceled is {$600.00} or more and the lender is a financial institution, credit union XXXX federal government agency, or other applicable entity, as discussed earlier in chapter 1.

Also, if your debt is canceled and the lender must file Form 1099-C, the lender can include the information about the abandonment on that form instead of on Form 1099-A. The lender must file Form 1099-C and send you a copy if the amount of debt canceled is {$600.00} or more and the lender is a financial in-situation, credit union, federal government agency, or other applicable entity, as discussed earlier in chapter 1. For abandonments of property and debt cancellations occurring in XXXX, these forms should be sent to you by XXXX XXXX XXXX. This has been requested several times since the inception of this debt based on the numerous disputes requested outlying this information listed as cancelled debt, but denying my right to remain compliant with federal taxes as the information is never furnished for the 1099-C for legal purposes is in direct violation of FCRA guidelines : As this was a request to reinvestigate the following Accounts violates FCRA Rule 15 US Code 1681i-Procedure in case of Disputed accuracy has been violated as my many attempts for disputing the listed accounts are not being properly investigated as stated above 1099-C have not been provided for these accounts after several attempts to request the information for legal purposes that align with my staying compliant with federal taxes, are listed below and I am requesting the information be deleted due to non-compliance of FCRA Rule 15 US Code 1681i Procedure In case Of Disputed Accuracy Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) permitting motion to dismiss for failure of the complaint to state a claim on which relief can be granted.

This resulted in me having to collect unemployment benefits while I seek new employment. The State of Arizona contracts with Way2Go Card/Conduent Corporation , which provides a barely functioning application/website that unemployment benefits are deposited onto. The application for the XXXX ( XXXX ) operating system is extremely glitchy, slow and unresponsive. I almost never used the app other than to transfer funds into my checking account, which worked just fine up until approximately three weeks ago. Out of nowhere, after the application redirected me to a confirmation page indicating that my transfer was successful, I noticed that the intended transfer never made it to my bank account. 

I was suspicious as to why, so I attempted to transfer again. The same exact event occurred where the funds were acknowledged to have been "" transferred '', yet the transfer never took place and it was sent back to the prepaid card again. I called and spoke to a representative whom assured me that I could use any certain types of ATM machines listed on their online portal where I would not incur a surcharge. I visited the ATM in which the representative told me I could use free of charge ; this turned out to be not true, as the same ATM we discussed charged me a fee. Rather than drive all around town and try to find others, I simply accepted the fee and withdrew the funds. 

I called back later that day to speak to another agent and find out why I was being charged an ATM fee when I shouldn't have. That agent I spoke to advised me that their software application flagged my transfers as fraudulent, despite the transfers working like clockwork for the past XXXX months. Her thought process behind this ( as she was explaining it to me ) was that it "" could be fraud even though its been going to my account the whole time ''. This is very illogical and I should have been notified either via the application that fraudulent activity was suspected, or someone should have attempted to contact me ; neither happened. 

Furthermore, that agent I spoke to advised me that "" only some of the ATMs '' were free of charge, and that if I wanted to remove the block on my account ( that I was never properly notified about ), I would have to manually take pictures of personal information that had to match their requirements exactly. XXXX of these requirements happened to be a drivers license with my physical address matching ; which I can not provide. 

In summary, this is a very poorly designed application that is causing its unemployed users to incur unnecessary fees.

Witch was now made into 2 separate claim. Now over my personal phone I was magically verified. That was my first set of issues. Now waiting on any information on the status of my claim I to this day have not received any documentation on the matter. Seventeen ( 17 ) days into my claim I first get a denial on the second claim number on the 11th day, no documents on why or how they reached that decision, as well as the factors I requested to know. The first claim of non archived transactions.is still ln pending status. This is not making sense to me so I look into the matter, it is to my understanding that my claim of the archived transactions was denied solely on the possibility of the bank not being able to go after the merchant for funds I disputed. I don't think that's complaint with EFTA mainly in regard to regulation E. The have not handled my dispute in any way shape or form compliant to the specific rules that are laid out in the law under regulation E. Further more, the time fram is past the 10 days required by the law in the EFTA under regulation E 1005.11, from the time I disputed the transactions, to statement plus 60 days I should be extended provisional credit. That's just the EFTA. Not only that fact XXXX requires them to provide provisional credits after 5DAYS! Being that these people ( BOA ) has gone on record stating they let XXXX XXXX dollars into the hands of criminals, I'm not understanding why they think they can keep my benefits from me. Regulation E also states that if they are to provide me with provisional credit, they can request I put this in writing. Witch they have not requested at this time. They have requested I send in my drivers licence and medical documents, witch is a violation of the privacy act of 1947, as well as HIPPA. So I comply, they give me a fax number to send it to. I call later on to check the status and they don't have them and even state that I was given the wrong fax number, now due to the mis information given to me by the rep of bank of america some random fax machine has my medical documentation, as well as a copy of my drivers license information. I tell they this and they say all they can do is submit a complaint, witch I doubt they did.and they give me a new fax number to now haven't to find a way to get out and send out again. This a huge violation of my rights and I'm furious about the whole thing. Being that I'm trying to get the benefits I need witch are necessary to my survival at this point I do it again and send them out and when I call in 3 business days later the documents are still not attached and the customer service rep tells me "" well everyone shares a fax so ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED ''. Please refer to all the recorded phone conversations to see what I'm saying is true. How is it that a bank is letting everyone have access to a consumers private information. I will be shocked to learn that up to this day they still havet submitted my documents. When I ask to speak to a supervisor they simply say they will tell you the same thing and that they don't have back office access to further look into my concerns, so in a nut shell I'm still with out payment while they are taking more then ten ( 10 ) Business days to investigate the matter but they have requested my personal medical information then had me send it to the wrong fax number, and when I asked they said '' well its not mandatory, we ask if your willing to submit them under your own interest of getting a verdict on your dispute. THATS NOT HOW THEY WORDED IT WHEN THE REQUSTED THAT I SEND IN THOSE MEDICAL DOCUMENTS. This is criminal to say the least and I'm submitting a second complaint because after the first one I got one email from XXXX XXXX stating I would hear back in 48 hrs and I haven't received anything since that email was sent to me six days ago. I called in today and REQUSTED to be connected with a supervisor and the lady said well they wont tell you anything different then me and I replied on since my status is showing pending and I have concerns on regulation E compliance. Why isn't there anyone I can speak to and she then stated that they don't have anyone that can give me any more information on the matter that I have to wait for a decision. Being that these people are most likely not properly trained on how to handle these disputed while remaining in compliance with regulation is is no one fault but the company in my opinion so I thanked her for her help gave her a good score on their survey as I always do and came back to the cfpb to submit this second complaint.im in serious need or my earned benefits as a consumer and they being with held from me using sneaking tactics will not be tolerated, i have asked on multiple occasions on where i would submitted paperwork regarding litigation on the matter since they cant seem to remain in honor when handling consum er information and concerns and again got the same generated answer that states they don't have any further information on the matter.

I told her I did not manually make the charge but it could be a monthly draft. I reiterated I just wanted my account unlocked to have online access. During the back and forth exchange she made reference to my card being already blocked. I shouted to her, "" I never authorized you to do that. This is the same {$39.00} charged monthly! '' While going back to look through my billing. PayPal should have never sent a "" fraud alert '' for a charge that has been billed monthly since XXXX of 2023 ( See attached ). Agent stated based on my response that is why it was blocked. I asked her if she knew what the word manually meant and repeated again angrily, "" I did not give you permission to block my card. I never said my card was lost or stolen. I never stated the charge was fraud. '' I told her she illegally blocked my card. This card still had a remaining balance from my social security benefits. I also told her this card is the card account that my benefits are deposited on and that I would be contacting a government agency in reference to the deceptive behavior. I requested to speak to a supervisor. The agent then transferred me back into the initial que with the main menu options. I called back a second time and spoke with an agent by the name of XXXX. I rehashed the entire situation. I asked for a supervisor. I was put on hold for XXXX minutes before XXXX then disconnected my call. A XXXX call was placed, speaking to agent XXXX, then explaining the same situation. I requested a supervisor once again, however XXXX stated that he would need to transfer me to another line, customer service in order to get my card unblocked. I asked him to confirm that customer service would be able to unblock my card and he answered in the affirmative, "" Yes they will. '' After being transferred to a customer service agent I was informed that in no way could my card be unblocked. PayPal does not unblock cards once they have been reported lost or stolen. My question to the agent, "" When exactly was the card reported lost or stolen? '' He replied, "" It was reported today XX/XX/XXXX. '' Supposedly I verified the transactions as fraud through either text message or via email. ( see email attached confirming I never responded to the fraud alert and phone logs confirming fraud alert text was never sent to me ) I explained to the agent that no one ever sent me a text to confirm, AND that I never responded to the email.

What's more troubling, outside of the fact that I never authorized the block, I should have never received a fraud alert for a charge that has been billed to me monthly since XX/XX/2023. PayPal has done this on numerous occasions by obstructing my use of my government benefits. This practice of "" randomly '' locking and or blocking cards/accounts w/o justification is an illegal business practice. There was no reason for PayPal NetSpend to send out a fraud alert and then have a customer service agent state the reason for the fraud alert was due to a charge that is unfamiliar to their system. This statement is completely false, and charge has been "" familiar '' to their system at least for the last 14 months.

Agents attempted to convince me I responded to either a text message or an email confirming the charge was fraud. To reiterate, I did neither. I never responded to a fraud alert email and fraud alert text message was never sent. ( see attached cell phone log ).

BofA has had close to 4 years to investigate the fraud on my account. How much more time does the bank need? They are given two billing cycles and no more than 90 days to repair this mess and 4 years later here we are. While disputing these fraudulent charges I was never issued any type of provisional credit. My account was not closed nor was the card closed by the bank and a new card issued. This continued to pose huge problems as my number was being used both Internationally and here in the states. The fraud continued due to the lack of any security protection on the XXXX cards. This was a criminals heaven. I would wait on 6 hour hold times just to hear that the bank felt the charges were mine. Knowing they werent I began to become very proactive and with my due diligence began getting some of the money back. I knew something was off with the bank when they said to me that I could be going to a XXXX based dentist be on a XXXX XXXX shopping spree and be standing at an ATM in XXXX all within moments of one another. I gave them names of ATM owners I gave them names of store owners and they never filed any type of dispute charges on my behalf. How do I know this?? Three days ago I was on the phone with BofA claims and I was told that the XXXX XXXX shopping spree was still on my statement. When I found out that it was a gentleman who swiped the card numeorus times and was denied. The last time he swiped time XXXX or XXXX the bank approved the transaction. The manager said the moment your bank disputes the charge we would be happy to help you get your funds but the bank must initiate the claim. Now here is a bank who swears that the charges are mine and the people, places and things I have shown are not. Covid was in full swing there was no travel allowed. No crossing broders of other countries. But BofA said the charges are yours and that was that. Now I am owed XXXX and that is what I expect back. This has gone XXXX XXXX XXXX of absurd and to keep me waiting on top of the 4 I have waited is not right. If you had done your investigation when I called this would have been a closed deal. Why? Because you would have seen that the dentists, shopping sprees, wix, and all other items disputed are not mine. 

You have had more than ample time to do this right. The letters I received XX/XX/year> saying you're done with your investigation and the charges are still mine is false. 

Having my money stolen from me is wrong having a bank where the cards they issued had no security on them is negligent. Bank of America you need to be held accountable for this. You allowed my money to be stolen while you sit back and say "" the charges are XXXX 's '' is false.

Like many others, I relied on both federal and private student loans to finance my education at the institution.

Currently, I am diligently repaying my private loans through Launch, but I am encountering significant difficulty due to the terms of the loan. My lender, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, has imposed a high interest rate, rendering my monthly payments unmanageableespecially since I lost my job in XXXX. 

I am reaching out to urge you to consider extending student loan relief to borrowers who, like me, used private loans to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. The Department of Education recently announced federal loan forgiveness for borrowers from this period, citing XXXX XXXX XXXX  misrepresentation of job prospects. 

It is reasonable to infer that similar misrepresentations may have affected students who relied on private loans. As a result, many of us are now grappling with significant debt for an education that may not have met the promises made to us, leading to undue financial hardship.

I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) consider providing relief for private loans used to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX  during the same period covered by the federal loan forgiveness program ( XXXX ).

A third loan, for XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX) should be discharged under the Dept. of Educations ( ED ) one-time waiver adjustment.

I. BACKGROUND ON STUDENT LOANS My loan history is as follows : -XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXXloans that entered into payment status on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX loans that entered into payment status on XX/XX/XXXX. 

-XX/XX/XXXX: A mix of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loans entered that into repayment on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. 

My XXXX loans were serviced by the following : ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) and ( XXXX ) Nelnet ( XXXX ). 

The XXXX Loans were serviced by XXXX ( XXXX ). 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX and XXXX loans were consolidated ( the XXXX Consolidation '' ) into an XXXX consolidation loan, which was serviced by XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX ). XXXX serviced the 1st Consolidation from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

My XX/XX/XXXX loans were originally serviced by both XX/XX/XXXXand XXXX XXXX, aka XX/XX/XXXX. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX all of my XXXX loans and the previously consolidated XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loans were combined into a XX/XX/XXXX loans ( subsidized and unsubsidized ) with XX/XX/XXXX( the 2nd Consolidation ). After XXXX stopped servicing federal student loans altogether, EdFinancial took over and is the current servicer of my XXXX XXXX loan ( the XX/XX/XXXX ). 

II. BORROWER DEFENSE APPLICATION HISTORY On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed Borrower Defense Applications for my XXXX ( XX/XX/0152 ) and XXXX ( XX/XX/0152) loans, respectively. Due to these XX/XX/XXXXapplications, I am a class member in the XX/XX/XXXX. My XXXX XXXX application is eligible for discharge as an Exhibit C school. My XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I attended prior to ownership by XXXX XXXX ) is part of the XX/XX/XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I initially received notice that both XX/XX/XXXXApplications were denied, and an interest credit of {$12000.00} would be applied to my account because it took XXXX an extended period of time to review my claim. See, XX/XX/XXXX Correspondence from XXXX attached. I have been unable to verify whether XXXX properly applied the interest credit to my account. 

After the Settlement Agreement was approved in XXXX XXXX XXXX, both XX/XX/XXXXdenials were rescinded. By XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from ED, advising me that my XXXX XXXX application would be re-reviewed. Specifically, the letter states that : Your federal loans will stay in forbearance or stopped collection status until your application is granted or denied and any relief is provided. For this period of forbearance or stopped collection status, the Department will not make you pay any interest that accrues on your federal loans.

The Settlement Agreement also meant that my XXXX loan would be discharged via the automatic discharge provision as XXXX is an Exhibit C school. I received confirmation of this via an email from ED on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, ED notified me that my XXXX XXXX application had been approved and that the loans were eligible for discharge. 

Even with two XXXX XXXX approvals, little activity has occurred on my account. That is why it came as a huge shock when I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from EdFinancial stating that they discharged 100 % of my XXXX loans : {$31000.00} in principal, and {$10000.00} towards interest because it took an extended period of time to review my claim. See, XX/XX/XXXX EdFinancial letter attached.

I also attach EdFinancials payment account history from its website as of XX/XX/XXXX. As you can see, it reflects none of the adjustments or credits stated in the XX/XX/XXXX letter. If you review my EdFinancial account history, the only credits and/or adjustments after made to my account are as follows : {$5300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$2800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Where is the alleged {$31000.00} that was 100 % discharged? Where is the {$10000.00} interest credit? To put things in perspective, my starting balance at the time EdFinancial took over my loans was {$150000.00}. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my balance with EdFinancial is {$140000.00}. How is it that my discharge is complete when my {$30000.00} + {$10000.00} discharge resulted in a net different of {$13000.00}?

Even more troubling is that EdFinancial inexplicably added back {$12000.00} as interest, back-dating the charge to XX/XX/XXXX. This is in the exact same amount of interest credit I was entitled to receive when my XX/XX/XXXXApplications were denied on XX/XX/XXXX. To add insult to injury, credit adjustments were made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2800.00} ; however, all of this was applied to interest, which had now ballooned due to EdFinancial charging me {$12000.00} in interest. Keep in mind that the {$12000.00} in interest that was supposed to be credited accrued prior to XX/XX/XXXX, and includes interest that accrued while all my loans were consolidated ( XXXX, XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX). It is completely inappropriate to be re-assessed this full amount of interest, which basically accrued prior to any of my loans being discharged. It is also unfair to after-the-fact try and tack this back on, after being advised that it would be removed.

It is HIGHLY DISTRESSING to see, after my discharge is 100 % complete letter that ( a ) none of the supposed credits or discharged amounts even show up in EdFinancials account history, ( b ) only smaller amounts were discharged {$5300.00} and {$2800.00}, ( c ) it doesnt appear that deductions were made to account for interest that accrued, capitalized, or interest that I paid for prior over the course of the loans lifetime, and the coup d'tat : seeing my balance drastically increase due to unexpalined interest charges.

When I questioned EdFinancial on this, they indicated they have no record of even sending me the XX/XX/XXXX letter and that my discharge is still processing. They had no idea why the interest was added, stating they were instructed to do so by ED. EdFinancial has no idea on when or whether a refund should be issued. They know absolutely nothing. What is the point of even having a loan servicer if they cant answer a basic question such as why interest was added to my account? These confusing messages are frustrating and are symptomatic of how disjointed this entire process has been for each class member and all student loans borrowers overall. I am tilting at windmills and see no end in sight and feel that I am being victimized by continued bungling of my accounts. This is crushing, after holding out such hope that I would see some form of relief.

More recently, on XX/XX/XXXX, i spoke by phone conf w/ an Edfinancial customer service agent, by the name of XXXX . I asked him to explain about what instructions EdFinancial received from ED regarding the large interest charge. 

XXXX confirmed a XX/XX/XXXX notation someone EdFinancial had made, indicated that per XX/XX/XXXXemail w/ borrower defense write off portion of interest due to delayed process : applied {$960.00} XXXX ( loan XXXX ) ; {$1800.00} XXXX ( loan XXXX ) interest credits. It also noted "" w/ new interest CREDIT prev [ previous ] applied on XX/XX/XXXX for {$4900.00} XXXX and {$7800.00} XXXX has been reapplied to loans. '' I asked him for clarification regarding the {$4900.00} and {$7800.00} amounts. XXXX indicated that those should be applied as credits. I asked him to review account history to see credits/debits applied to my account and tell me what he sees. This is interesting he says. It shows the write off on XX/XX/XXXX : {$2800.00}. Then he acknowledges he saw : {$12000.00} ( which is the grand total of {$4900.00} and {$7800.00} ) was ADDED to my account as a charge. I asked him to confirm additional credits he saw on my account. He confirmed that after the XX/XX/XXXX was added back to my account, that a {$2800.00} credit was then applied against the XX/XX/XXXXXXXX interest that was wrongly added to my account. 
I advised him that due to this error : -Since the XX/XX/XXXX wasnt applied properly as a credit, interest is accruing daily on an incorrect, higher principal balance ; -Instead of the {$2800.00} being applied properly as a credit against my balance, it was applied to the wrongfully added XX/XX/XXXX, thus diluting my overall discharge to which I am entitled. 

-I advised that if further credits come in and/or discharge requests come in from ED it will now be applied to an incorrect balance, due to the incorrect addition of XX/XX/XXXX to my account, along with the daily interest rate continuing to accrue. 

XXXX says : sees my complaints : on this : Says XX/XX/XXXX[ customer resolution unit ] team taking a look at it. Trying to figure out how to resolve it. He asked if I recd any resopnses from XX/XX/XXXX? I told him yes, I recd several emails from Edfinancial saying they are looking into it that my account is in admin forbearance, that this request has been given emergency status I asked which dept entered XX/XX/XXXXXXXX interest credit as a charge. He says it was entered Edfinancials Finance dept. 
I asked him when was XX/XX/XXXX added as a charge to the account : It was entered on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The code for entry : XXXX [ Per XXXX, payments & billing code ]. Comment about XX/XX/XXXX addition is the per XX/XX/XXXXemail as cited above. 

I asked him to explain why the XX/XX/XXXX in interest, being that it was entered to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, why was it back dated to XX/XX/XXXX. He says the notes dont explain why and he cant give me an explanation as to why it was back dated. While he acknowledged the error, he can not tell me when it will get fixed.

III. XXXX MISSING PAYMENT HISTORY POST-CONSOLIDATION Student loan payments I made after the 2nd Consolidation with XX/XX/XXXX( between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX that total approximately {$1400.00} ) are missing from my payment history. ( Refer to my Student Aid Feedback XXXX # XXXX ). XXXX assured me they would look into this, but it was never resolved. EdFinancial, as the successor servicer, also shows that I made no payments after XX/XX/XXXX. Considering that I was on an IDR plan, missing payments have major consequences. Notably, these missing payments are crucial to have for my loan servicer to be able to calculate my refund payment under XX/XX/XXXX, as payments made during that time period were after the 2nd Consolidation, and paid towards both my XXXX and XXXX loans. 

In XXXX XXXX XXXX filed on XX/XX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, he indicated that for borrowers with loans transferred from decommissioned servicers, obtaining additional payment information can be difficult if not impossible. As a borrower who has three loan servicers who are no longer in operation since loan inception, ( XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX), and who actually has payments missing from my account history through XXXX, I have grave concerns this means that I will be short-changed on the relief to which I am entitled.

IV. ONE TIME WAIVER ADJUSTMENT STATUS Per EDs IDR one-time waiver adjustment, I am entitled to total discharge of all of my loans. My graduate loans were consolidated with my oldest undergraduate loans in XXXX. Since my oldest loan has been in repayment status since XXXX, I have now surpassed 25 years mark of payment months. Per guidance on EDs website regarding the one-time waiver adjustment [ a ] ssuming your repayment history overlaps for each loan, the consolidation loan will be credited with the longest amount of time in repayment of the loans that were consolidated. As I am not receiving any form of monetary refund for payments held under XXXX loans, those payment should count towards IDR payment months. In light of EDs acknowledgment of missing payment history, and indeed, I have three decomissioned loan servicers in my loan history, I am concerned that I am not being given the proper payment credits, because I I have yet to receive any notice that all my loans qualify for forgiveness due to reaching the 300 month payment mark.

V. CONCLUSION Based on the above issues, I request detailed answers to the following questions : Why did EdFinancial charge me {$12000.00}, back dated to XX/XX/XXXX, which shouldve been applied as a credit on my account? 

Why is my payment history missing and what will ED do to resolve this prior to calculating my refund amount?

Does EdFinancials have a complete payment history for my XXXX and XXXX loans since inception from all prior loan servicers, including XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX from XXXX through the present? 

If EdFinancial is unable to obtain my entire payment /account history since the loans inception, advise me immediately as to : ( i ) Which specific servicers records are missing ; ( ii ) How will Edfinancial calculate interest I paid over the loans life history, which I am entitled to receive credit for as part of my settlement relief ; ( iii ) How will Edfi calculate the interest amounts that accrued over and above the amount of interest paid, which also should be credited as part of my settlement relief ; ( iv ) How will Edfi calculate my refund payments where servicers records are missing, including my missing XX/XX/XXXXpayments. 

( v ) Where loan servicer payment history is confirmed missing, how will this impact my IDR one-time waiver adjustment for the period of time where payment history is missing; and ( vi ) Where loan servicer payment history is confirmed missing, how can Edfi legally continue to collect on my debt?

Provide confirmation that discharge of my loans through XX/XX/XXXX will not impact my eligibility for the IDR one time waiver adjustment, since I will not be receving a refund on any amounts paid on XXXX Loans ; I require confirmation in writing about EDs position for IDR waiver adjustment counts for those who do receive discharge under XX/XX/XXXX who also had loans consolidated with non-eligible schools?

What exact instructions has ED provided to EdFinancial in regards to discharging my XXXX XXXX, including amounts to be discharged for principal and interest.

For the {$10000.00} interest credit that was supposed to be applied pursuant to my discharge letter, what period of time does this interest cover? When will this be applied to my account?

For the {$31000.00} in principal discharge that was supposed to be applied to my account when will this reflected?

What is the amount of interest that accured and capitalized on my XXXX loan since inception that is being applied as a credit to my account? 

What is the status of my refund? I was expecting a refund by XX/XX/XXXX.

05/21/24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"MOHELA has incorrectly billed me and is negligent in following fair billing regulations according to the Federal Student Aid Office. 

Today, XX/XX/year> I received written correspondence from MOHELA delivered by XXXX including a billing statement dated XX/XX/year> and confirmation of consolidation XX/XX/year> addressed with the incorrect name As this is XXXX of many ongoing grievances with MOHELA and I am still awaiting communication, correction, rectification, and restitution from MOHELA about those matters, this letter adds on to a building case demonstrating MOHELAs unfair, harmful, and negligent practices. I first address errors made by MOHELA regarding my legal name then I address the most recent errors, negligence, and unfair billing practices in collecting debt. 

The correspondence for my recently processed consolidation loan is incorrectly addressed to a previous name I had. I have already submitted name change documentation with MOHELA and this name change was correctly reflected on my application documents for loan consolidation. With thousands of dollars being exchanged on my behalf, it is a reasonable expectation that MOHELA maintain accurate records without my reminding or needing my attention of correction such as but not limited to my legal name. 
MOHELA is negligent with their billing practice and fails to follow consumer regulations of and rights under consumer protection and violates fair debt collection practices. According to the Federal Student Aid OfficXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) Your loan servicer will send you your billing statement at least 21 days before your payment is due. 
The bill is dated XX/XX/year>, which is less then the 21 days stipulated by the Federal Student Aid Office and Code of Massachusetts Regulations XXXX XXXX. The bill was generated on XX/XX/year> which is XXXX calendar day before the written notice of consolidation and loan servicing was created meaning that the MOHELA billed me prior to giving me notice of a schedule of terms, payments, and details of the loan. As I received this bill statement less than XXXX calendar days before the due date of XX/XX/year> and the statement itself is dated less than 21 days prior to the due date, this written notice violates the guidelines, regulations of the Federal Student Loan Office. It is also a clear violation of Code of Massachusetts Regulations Title 209.

The written correspondence does not match the payment due as listed on the website. The written notice has a different amount due on XX/XX/year> then what is on the website. Furthmore this is a new website that MOHELA uses. MOHELA 's old website does not give notice of my account migrating to a new website nor does it redirect consumers to the new one. This is intentionally misleading and creates another obstacle and hindance to access online accounts to make timely payments. 

Without a reasonable timeline for written notice, a reasonable time to make payment, and obstacles such as the company 's website failure to reflect to accurate amounts with written correspondence and misleading users from XXXX old website, along with incorrect information such as my name, MOHELA creates an burden and hardship to make timely which negatively impacts my financial and consumer well-being and could constitute MOHELAs intentional obstruction and negligence As indicated in prior correspondence and prior issues with the company, including a case that is still open through the CFPB, MOHELA has XXXX pattern of negligent and harmful practices that negatively impact my financial and consumer well-being.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,MA,01906,,Consent provided,Web,05/22/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9061549,"MOHELA incorrectly billed the consumer, violating fair billing regulations.

It is a stark reality that the XXXX XXXX, along with their parent company, XXXX, have been subjected to investigations by numerous state attorneys general, resulting in damning findings of fraudulent activities. 

Recently, in response to the egregious actions of institutions like the XXXX XXXX, the XXXX  administration has taken a commendable step by announcing a sweeping discharge of loans for individuals enrolled at these institutions between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. This move offers a glimmer of hope for those burdened by the weight of unjust debt. 

As I await the impending discharge of my federal loans and the subsequent repair of my credit, I am compelled to address the insidious practices of Navient. Not only have I dutifully repaid a significant portion of my original loans, including interest in the amount of {$41000.00} in Federal loans and {$31000.00} in Private loans, but I also demand restitution for the predatory behavior exhibited by Navient. 

The symbiotic relationship between Navient and for-profit online schools, facilitated by preferential lending arrangements, is a stain on the integrity of the education finance system. It is evident that these loans, fraught with a high risk of default, were designed to exploit vulnerable students, leaving many in financial ruin. 

Navient 's track record of malfeasance extends beyond its collusion with for-profit institutions. The company has faced legal action from state attorneys general, allegations of deceptive loan practices, and accusations of illegal collection methods. Their recent attempts to absolve themselves of responsibility through superficial "" pilot programs '' are a slap in the face to those who have suffered at their hands. 

Under the FTC "" Holder Rule, '' Navient bears accountability for its role in perpetuating predatory lending practices, particularly in conjunction with online for-profit schools. Time is of the essence for Navient to rectify the injustices inflicted upon students who were lured into a web of deceit and financial exploitation. 

The call to action has been sounded by esteemed voices such as XXXX XXXX XXXX, who rightfully demands immediate discharge of these predatory loans. It is incumbent upon Navient to heed this clarion call and take swift and decisive action to alleviate the burdens of those they have wronged. This should also include refunds for payments made on these predatory loans. 

In conclusion, I implore all stakeholders to recognize the urgency of this matter and to stand in solidarity with those seeking redress. The time for accountability and restitution is now.

It is important to note that I never received a demand letter that outlined the debt or provided an opportunity for me to respond or arrange for payment.

The lack of preliminary communication clearly contradicts the FDCPAs mandate that debt collectors must provide a written notice of the debt within five days of initially contacting the consumer, outlining the amount of the debt and the creditors name, and informing the consumer of their right to dispute the debt.

XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Against Nissan Finance and Authorized Dealerships for Misleading Practices and Poor Customer Service Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Nissan Finance and its authorized dealerships, specifically XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, for their misleading practices, unscrupulous behavior, and overall poor handling of my vehicle lease end and purchase process. 

Background : I am the co-owner, along with XXXX XXXX, of a XXXX XXXX XXXX leased from Nissan Finance. As the lease neared its end, I attempted to either return the leased vehicle or purchase it, starting from XX/XX/XXXX. However, my efforts have been met with consistent evasion, misleading information, and highly unprofessional behavior from the staff at the aforementioned dealerships. 

XXXX XXXX : XXXX. Misleading Sales Tactics : Despite clear communication regarding my intent to return the vehicle or explore options for a new lease similar in terms to my previous arrangement, dealership personnel repeatedly attempted to steer me toward unfavorable and unsolicited trade-in deals. 
XXXX. Failure to XXXX XXXX : On multiple occasions, after receiving direct assurances via phone and email that my concerns would be addressed, I was subjected to the same unhelpful and aggressive sales tactics, with no genuine effort made to resolve my situation. 
XXXX. Negligence and Potential Financial Harm : Most concerning is the handling of my visit on XX/XX/XXXX, after receiving a repossession warning from Nissan Finance. The dealerships staff ran my credit without achieving any result and proposed switching me to an inferior vehicle make, not aligning with the contractual agreement of having the option to purchase the leased vehicle. 

This series of actions demonstrates a pattern of deceptive practices and customer manipulation aimed at maximizing dealership profits at the expense of consumer rights and transparency. 

Request for Action : I urge the CFPB to investigate these practices and take appropriate action to ensure accountability and prevent further exploitation of consumers. I also seek assistance in resolving the matter with Nissan Finance directly, ensuring that my consumer rights are upheld and that any negative impact on my credit score is avoided. 

Please find attached all relevant communications and documentation supporting my claims. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving these issues.

On [ XX/XX/XXXX ], I applied for a car loan with [ Navy federal ]. Unfortunately, my application was denied, citing reasons that were not adequately explained to me. Upon further investigation, I believe that my application may have been denied in violation of federal equal rights laws and CFR laws.

According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) and Regulation B of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), lenders are prohibited from discriminating against applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of income from public assistance programs. I have reason to believe that my application denial may have been influenced by one or more of these protected factors.

Furthermore, Regulation B requires lenders to provide applicants with a written explanation of the reasons for adverse action, such as a loan denial. However, I did not receive a clear and specific explanation for the denial of my car loan application, which may be a violation of Regulation B.

I am deeply concerned about the potential violation of my rights under federal equal rights laws and CFR laws. I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

05/02/24,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Account reinstatement or redemption after repossession,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I moved to XXXX, XXXX. Unlike every other company in the USA, Honda did not bother to process my change of address form registered with the Post Office. Since I didnt get a bill from them, I didnt pay it. In XXXX of XXXX, they designed to notice my change of address form and sent me letter to that effect. 

Subsequently, I got a catchup bill from them and a threat to reposess. I was able to catch them up, but since they would no longer take electronic payment, I was forced to go to XXXX and pay {$60.00} for a XXXX, in addition to late fees. 
Their IT department incompetence in processing the change of address notifications from the US Postal Service is not my fault, and I should not be liable for late fees. 

On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, I got out of the hospital after 40 days to discover that my car had been repossessed by Honda. 

Since I had spent 40 days in the hospital I immediately reviewed the month of mail. In that mail, I discovered a letter from Honda stating that I had 10 days extension available before they sold it, and that they would reinstate my loan for {$3300.00}. They said I had to request the extension in writing, and provided an address by XX/XX/XXXX, but they did not provide a fax number. They also said they were going to notify my wife, as a cosigner on the loan, which I know they did not do, because my wife went into the local XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since it was more than 7 days, and I knew that it would take more than 7 days for the letter to reach them, and I didnt have the funds readily available and it would take time to pull the money out of my retirement accounts, I started trying to find legal help. Unfortunately, lawyers are too specialized so I wasnt able to find a lawyer in time. 

As a XXXX XXXXXXXX, I called them on XX/XX/XXXX anyways, and they provided a fax number. At the time, my phone options werent very good, but I was able to take a picture of their form, and send it to them. Unfortunately, they couldnt read the fax ... Much XXXX ensued over the next XXXX days, and finally, they accepted my extension after I told them they were acting in bad faith, but they were only going to give me 2 days, not XXXX. 

In the meantime, I had tried to get the repossession company to hold the car while I worked out things with Honda to discover that Honda had sent the car to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, two days prior to the extension deadline Honda refused to tell me where the auction was going to be held, a violation of Federal Law, but a lady at the local auction house was nice enough to track down the car for me ( why I moved to XXXX  ). 

After some back and forth, Honda agreed to reinstate the loan, but now the fee had increased to {$5000.00} and change. The XXXX statement showed 12 monthly late fees all charged on the same day. Also, there were now additional repo fees of {$400.00}. 

I called Honda and asked them to explain, and they sent me a payment history which made no sense, and had no explanation of the XXXX XXXX Bills or the additional late fees. 
So heres the thing. Theres this principle of XXXX law called just notification which applies in my case, because I had an uXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. So Hondas claim of requiring notification to exercise XXXX in my contract is void, and bad law. XXXX XXXXXXXX are just as valid as physical XXXX Also, Honda has yet to explain how my reinstatement went from {$4000.00} to $ XXXX. Finally, jumping the XXXX on the extension by 2 days before the notification deadline, puts any Honda expenses during that period as irrelevant as they had no legal rights to the car yet. Plus they still havent notified my wife Redeeming the car wasnt enough, I had to pay {$300.00} to have the car towed back to my house since I was XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time. 
Also, Honda is responsible for any/all damage to my vehicle while in their possession. While physically the car is ok, theres a subtle issue in that they re-keyed the car while it was on the repo lot. Unfortunately, when you do that on a XXXX XXXX XXXX, it invalidates all the other key fobs. 
So now I have XXXX key fobs. The repo key fob has an incorrectly cut physical key inside it, so it cant be used to unlock the car manually. The other XXXX key fobs are invalid, though the physical key works, and the battery is dead workaround of holding the key against the start button works with the old keys but not the repo key. Recently, the repo key fob stopped working to start and stop the car. I opened it up to check and discovered it was using a XXXX battery instead of a XXXX. Replacing the battery in all XXXX key fobs, Ive been able to work around this, but I need to visit an automotive locksmith to resolve this issue, which is an additional expense. 
The XXXX says that its the love of money that is the root of all evil, and while Im sure Honda Financial feels justified in their treatment of me based on them playing the percentages across all their customers, their rigidity and rules have caused me hardship and XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are still XXXX. I understand that Im an exception, but as a user interface engineer I know that humans are messy creatures.

Mercedes Benz financial charged a {$600.00} fee to defer lease payments ; essentially the fee includes less than {$50.00} in taxes to put the payment on the back end of the contract. The other cost is the administrative cost for the deferment. Which led me to ask the question, How does this benefit the me, the owner, during financial hardship. Specifically, if I am required to pay {$600.00} that I dont have due to extenuating circumstances ; and that has led to financial hardship? The representative then said, '' the least I can accept today is {$300.00}. '' I explained to the agent that I did not have the {$300.00} and that the deferral program was at best - predatory and didnt offer a tangible benefit for persons who were experiencing a financial hardship but was a means for Mercedes Benz to either make money off consumers during periods of hardship or block utilization of the deferment program.

05/29/24,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"I am reaching out to express concerns and reasons that I have to believe that XXXX, XXXX, Bridgecrest, and all of its affiliates are committing a plethora of financial crimes and nefarious business practices that are in direct violation/ breach of but not limited to their prospectus, trust indenture agreement, codes of federal regulation, United States codes, New Jersey Administrative Codes , Truth in Lending Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Privacy Act of 1974 and various Securities Exchange Commission violations.

Pursuant to 15 U.S. code 1602 ( i ), Ientered into a consumer credit transaction with CARVANA and NOT BRIDGECREST, to purchase a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX online platform/ website on XX/XX/XXXX. I rendered a downpayment of {$500.00} which is a direct violation of 15 U.S. Code 1605 which clearly states that the finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.

Upon receiving the car via CARVANAs delivery methods, I received a blue folder which only contained one ( the first ) page of the contract. As a result of my curiosity over the last couple of weeks, I actually went through the folder and noticed I only had the first page of the contract after all this time. This folder was never opened, added to or subtracted from as it sat in a home safe from the time I got the car until now. 
Shortly after realizing this, I began to contact BRIDGECREST for a copy of the contract being that they were the ones I was making payments to. They told me that I had to reach out to XXXX XXXX because they were the dealer. 

I then contacted XXXX XXXX for a full contract for me to review and I was questioned about what I needed it for on all recorded calls. I was finally able to get them to tell me that they will email a copy in a few days. Expecting to get an email from XXXX XXXX, I received an email from BRIDGECREST customer care containing the contract. I never signed any contracts or agreements with BRIDGECREST to make payments to them. I also had them send me an arbitration agreement that I never received or even signed from XXXX, XXXX. 

Shortly before receiving a copy view of the full contract from BRIDGECREST, I was told by XXXX via email on XX/XX/XXXX that they had NO RECORDS of my contract due to the age of the information in the system. I was also informed on a recorded line that I was not able to receive a physical billing statement via postal mail because they were a paperless company and I was unable to opt out of paperless billing that I never opted into. 
In the contract, it also says that this transaction took place at the dealers licensed location and that is not true. I had to wait weeks after XX/XX/XXXX to receive my contract from BRIDGECREST, not XXXX, XXXX. 

After being told that I could not receive a paper bill in the mail, I was sent a XXXX page physical printed document of all the payments made throughout the life of the loan/ contract thus far via certified mail. That doesnt sound like something a paperless company would do for no reason. Interestingly enough, I was also sent a very different contract titled : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that looks like it was signed with my electronic signature that I had never seen before. It is a lot shorter and very different from the one that I had in my possession ( XXXX pages ) since XXXX. It stated at the top right hand corners of each page that it was the Authoritative copy. Why was this never given to me to be signed? This new document looks as if I was physically in Georgia buying the vehicle. There is no evidence of any active or inactive UCC filings/ perfected liens on the vehicle to date in the state of Georgia on the XXXX website, or New Jersey XXXX my residence state ). How is there a security interest without a perfected lien? 

Furthermore, If I saw in this new contract that I received around XX/XX/XXXX, and it clearly stated verbatim : We agree to transfer to you and you agree to accept title and ownership of the vehicle in the state of the dealership address listed above. When we transfer title and the ownership of the vehicle to you, you may take delivery of the vehicle from us at our licensed dealership location shown above or you may make arrangements with us to have the vehicle transported to another usually agreed- upon location for your pickup. 
I would have immediately asked for my title and other ownership documents. 
I made sure to highlight this for your further viewing ( enclosed ). 


Where are titles and ownership documents that should have been transferred to me over 5 years ago? 

Why do I have two different purchase agreements in two different states for one vehicle? 

Is there some kind of fraudulent activity going on here?

As a long-standing and loyal customer of Honda vehicles , I have always valued the quality of their products and services. However, I find myself in an unprecedented and untenable situation that requires urgent attention and resolution. 

In late XXXX, my parked vehicle, the XXXX Honda XXXX, was unfortunately side-swiped, resulting in significant damage to the passenger side-view mirror and its assembly. Despite my diligent efforts to procure the necessary replacement part, I have been informed that it is currently backordered with no definite timeline for availability. This has left my vehicle with an expired safety inspection sticker, as I am unable to pass the inspection due to the broken mirror, posing a significant safety concern. 

I have reached out to Honda Corporate Office in an attempt to expedite the procurement process for the replacement part. However, after placing an order, which was subsequently canceled without my knowledge, I was informed that the part may not be available until midXXXX, with no guarantee of timely delivery. 

In light of these circumstances, I contacted XXXXmerican Honda Financial Corp. to explore the possibility of returning the leased vehicle and having the remainder of my lease payments waived, considering that I can not safely drive the vehicle due to the unresolved issue. Regrettably, I was only offered a two-month deferment on my lease payments, which does not address the fundamental issue at hand. 

I am deeply troubled by the prospect of being penalized for a situation that is beyond my control. The suggestion of an early lease termination fee of nearly {$4000.00}, in addition to the balance of the lease agreement, is both unjust and unreasonable.

05/01/24,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"On XXXX XXXX I made a payment on my auto loan account for {$1300.00} dollars and according to my records that payment should of been my last final payment. I then called global lending and spoke with XXXX different agents to verify my account way in fact paid in full.. they did verify that it was paid but that it would take 10 days for the payment to process and show on my account paid in full. So I waited until XX/XX/XXXX I logged on to the online portal and it showed what appeared to me a negative balance in the amount of ( = {$5800.00} ) so because it said negative I figured something was wrong with the payment I made XX/XX/XXXX so I made another payment for {$1500.00} and a few days later logged on again and it still had a negative balance so again I was trying to get this paid off asap I made XXXX more payments XXXX in amount of {$2000.00} and XXXX for {$5000.00} to bring that negative to a positive and to cover any fees for it being late and in negative. After I made these payments I called and spoke with an agent 2 days after I made the {$5000.00} dollar payment to ask questions about my account. They verified it was showing paid in full since XX/XX/XXXX I explained to them I was on their online portal payment center and it wasn't showing paid off and I explained to them it actually showed I owed a negative balance of ( - {$5800.00} ) dollars when it never showed that before I made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX they told me that they couldn't see that on their end and that my account was paid so I asked them to send me a payoff letter and they did. Then I asked about the XXXX overpayments I made after the final payment on XX/XX/XXXX. The agent said let him contact the payment processing department and see what's going on. After being on hold for XXXX min he gets back on the phone and tells me he's transferring me. Then a lady gets on phone and I explained to her I made XXXX over payments after my account was paid in full thinking that my final payment didn't go through because when I go on their online portal it shows me that I'm in negative and it doesn't show me that it's payed off the lady said that it's just their system updating and that I can call my bank. I explained to them I already did but they said I had to wait for the payment to processed before disputing payments. And that my auto financial company will issue me a refund after payments been posted. And the agent from global lending said very rudly that she dont know why I made those payments that they can't issue a refund until 45 days and that my payments won't get to me until after the 45 days I asked the lady about my title when I should receive that she said 45 days after my account being closed. A few days later I received my title in mail and a check for {$9.00} which was the difference from the payment I made XX/XX/XXXX that paid off my account. So I called globel lending again and told them I received my title and a overheat for {$9.00} but what about the overpayments they said they couldn't see any overpayment if I had confirmation number so I gave it to them and they checked with payment department and they said that I had to wait 10 days until payment was fully processed and that after its processed on their end they would have 45 days to send out my over payment. Everything everyone from global lending is telling me is different. So I called back XX/XX/XXXX spoke with an agent and before speaking with him the last time I called I did tell them that it's still not showing online my account is paid off when I go on their portal it's still showing negative and it shows the last payments I made which were the over payments. So this agent tells me he can see the over payments that I made and he'll put in a request for refund. He then transfer my call to payment processing or some other department that is when I spoke again with this rude lady that explained to me that my account is closed and paid in full I told her about their online portal how it's showing negative when I log on as a guest. She said that it's hasn't been fully updated but that pretty soon I won't beable to even log on because account is closed and I won't beable to do anything on there once it updates. I said really I just want my refund it was a clear mistake made on my part for misunderstanding their portal not being updated and it showing negative she said I had to wait 10 days I explained to her it's been since the XXXX and that we'll over 10 days and online it shows the last payment on my account was now XX/XX/XXXX and for the amount of XXXX that was updated but wasn't showing at all in the history the over payments could it be cause they refunded them she said no she dont know why it's showing that.so at this point I'm really concerned and scared that it's not showing anything about my overpayments to account on-line where and why was it showing the day before and not that day but I had already screen shot all the payments and overpayments because of how they were acting with me and my concerns then I asked when im getting my money back. And how I was concerned because it wasn't showing online anymore like it did before. She told me very rudly she dont know why I made those payments basically it's my fault. Their system wasn't updated correctly. But there's a request for refund but that I have to wait to see if its approved so XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I call and get totally different information them telling me that I should receive my first overpayment today which was XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and then XX/XX/XXXX the other XXXX payments will arrive I said ok well I didn't receive the check yesterday.

I just want my money back. And I'm so worried that their not gon na pay me my money back.

The car has to have major repairs several times which unfortunately has led to being repossessed 2x. 

The first time I paid my money, got the release and went and got my vehicle. 

This time has been the complete run around. I called in to see how much I would have to pay. They said it would have to be approved by a manager before they could do since it is 2nd repo. Said it will take 48 hours.

Call back in 48 hours, they tell me the amount, I make a {$150.00} payment. 
I tell them I will not be able to pay until the XXXX as I am a veteran and receive XXXX. They say ok. I call on the XXXX and discuss them with them. They told me they put a hold on the car so it won't be sent to the repo lot. At this point it was 45 minutes from my house.

After making the payment he tells me it will be 48-72 hours before I get the release. I ask why this isn't told to me before I make the payment? I mention the fact that the auction is scheduled on the XXXX. He says nothing i.can do. I hang up and realize I have never received a receipt for the payment I had made. I made several calls requesting a copy of my receipt they repeatedly told me that they sent it and it's my problem if I don't have it and they can't another copy! That night, westlake calls MY EX BOYFRIEND who is not listed as a reference or any type of contact on my account at all. So someone needs to explain how someone got his information or how he was contacted. I have a copy of the voicemail. The next morning I get the release and I call the tow yard where they tell me my vehicle was. That tow yard informs me that on the XXXX the vehicle was towed to XXXX AL. 5 hours away. I call XXXX and they inform me they have the vehicle but my tag and personal belongings are at the previous tow yard. I call the previous tow yard to make an appointment to get personal items, they tell me they don't have a release. I call west lake they said you don't get a release for your personal property. I explain they won't release my stuff until I get it. They said not our problem. When I called the auction yard they told me how shady westlake is.

05/03/24,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Unable to receive car title or other problem after the loan is paid off,"I purchased a vehicle through United Auto Acceptance on I believe XX/XX/XXXX and my final payment on the vehicle was made on XX/XX/XXXX. Ever since then though I have tried to reach out to UAA to obtain my title on this vehicle but as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have yet to receive the title or even a response at all. So far Ive called every number I was provided with as well as every number listed on the UAA webpage. I know Ive called well over a dozen times over the last XXXX years and Ive yet to speak with anyone. Each call is always the same, its an automated message that instructs me to leave a voicemail, which I do, but I never receive a call back. There was only one time that an actual real person answered and I explained to her all the trouble I have had trying to get my title and I asked her if she could help me. The representative was polite but she said that a different department handled title inquiries and that she would need to transfer me and before I could object she transferred me over and it went straight to a voicemail inbox. So I left a voicemail but quickly hung up and called back hoping someone would answer again but they never did. Ive also tried emailing the company many times. The email addresses I had were from past emails I had received from UAA representatives throughout my loan for things such as payment verifications and insurance status on the vehicle. But I never received a response from any of the emails either. Eventually I reached out to the dealership I had purchased the vehicle from in the hopes that they could help me with this. But they just informed that only my lender United Auto Acceptance would be able to help me with obtaining my title and they provided the contact information they had on file for UAA, which of course was the same information I already had. Finally I contacted my local county tag office to ask about the title process and to see if there was anything else I should be doing. The tag office informed me that once a vehicle is paid off then the lender automatically issues a new title in the buyers name and it is sent by mail to the new owner usually within 30 days. And since I have had the same address since I first purchased the vehicle Im sure the title was not sent. But of course there is no way of knowing what steps have been taken on this unless Im able to speak to someone regarding this issue. My hopes in submitting this is that someone at United Auto Acceptance will see this and help me resolve this issue or at the very least respond and inform me of what I can do to resolve this.",,UNITED AUTO ACCEPTANCE,GA,30265,,Consent provided,Web,05/03/24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8926211,"The consumer paid off their vehicle loan through United Auto Acceptance but has been unable to obtain the title despite numerous calls and emails over several years. The lender has not responded, and the consumer is seeking assistance to resolve the issue."
